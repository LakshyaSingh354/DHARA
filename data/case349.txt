           CIVIL MISCELLANEOUS APPEAL NO.270 OF 2022


JUDGMENT:
(Per Hon'ble Sri Justice P.Naveen Rao) Heard Sri Nikunj Dugar learned counsel for the appellant and Sri Damodar Mundra learned counsel for the respondents 2 to 4.
2. The brief facts of the appeal are that the appellant is a registered partnership firm under the provisions of the Indian Partnership Act, 1932. The appellant is the owner and possessor of the property being Plot Nos.1 to 4 and 13 to 16 in Sy.Nos.322, 323 and 326 of Quthbullapur village and Mandal, Medchal-Malkajgiri district, admeasuring 4444.44 square yards. The respondents are carrying business of real estate and development of immovable properties. The appellant initially entered into registered Development Agreement-cum-General Power of Attorney vide document no.1435/2014 dated 08.09.2014 registered at Sub-Registrar at Balanagar. In terms thereof, the respondents 1 to 3 were authorized to carryon the development of the above property. Agreement envisaged 43% of the built-up and saleable area on all the floors including the stilt/cellar together with all the general amenities, facilities etc. to the appellant and 57% to the developer. The agreement also envisaged completion of the project within 27 months with a grace period of 3 months from the date of PNR,J & SSRN,J CMA No.270 OF 2022 obtaining permission for construction from GHMC. The respondents 1 to 3 gave refundable security deposit without interest for a sum of 30,00,000/-. The respondents 1 to 3 obtained building permit No.52714/HO/NZ/Cir-15/2016, dated 03.12.2016.
3. During the subsistence of this agreement, respondent no.1 retired from the firm and respondent no.4 was admitted as partner of the respondent no.5. The appellant and the respondents entered into a supplementary agreement on 04.11.2017, wherein it was mutually agreed to reduce the ratio of the share of the owners from 43 % to 42% and the ratio of share of the builder increased from 57% to 58%. In accordance with new sharing ratio, the owner is entitled to 28 flats and the builder is entitled to 38 flats. Subsequently, the parties executed supplementary agreement dated 02.01.2019 to divide and distribute the constructed areas between the parties as per the ratio of 42% to owner and 58% to builder respectively. Subsequently, another supplementary agreement dated 17.01.2019 was entered into between the appellant and the respondents, whereby it was agreed to share the ground floor commercial space of 8000 square feet as per their sharing ratio of 42% and 58% respectively and it was also agreed to share the car parking in the same ratio.
PNR,J & SSRN,J CMA No.270 OF 2022
4. Disputes arose between the parties on various aspects. There was exchange of correspondence between the appellant and developer. In notice dated 03.09.2021, appellant invoked Arbitration clause nominating an Arbitrator. In reply notice dated 08.09.2021 developer has not agreed to the arbitrator nominated by the appellant and proposed alternative name which was not acceptable to the appellant. Pending reference to arbitration, appellant invoking Section 9 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (for short, Act, 1996) by filing Arb.O.P.No.5 of 2022 in the Court of XVI Additional District and Sessions Judge, Malkajgiri, old Ranga Redd District, presently Medchal Malkajgiri district, claiming that appellant is entitled to 3,09,78,000/- as rental damages, whereas he has only 1,00,00,000/- as security deposit, whereas the appellant apprehends that the respondents may walkout of the project without completing the project in all respects and in such an eventuality, it would be difficult to ensure from the developer completion of all the pending works and recovery of rental dues. He, therefore, prayed for order of attachment of suit schedule flats. He has also prayed to direct developer to complete the pending works as detailed in schedule 'B' and to appoint Advocate-Commissioner for local inspection to note physical features.
5. To note, a few grievances ventilated by the appellant in the Arb.O.P., are that the project was not completed by 03.04.2019 as agreed; that even before project was completed occupancy certificate was obtained PNR,J & SSRN,J CMA No.270 OF 2022 from GHMC; that several civil and other works are pending; that the flats delivered to the appellant are incomplete; that rent for the delayed period is not paid. The developer was required to pay 3,09,78,880/- after deducting 20,00,000/- already paid towards rental arrears and so on.
6. The developer has denied all the allegations. He has asserted that the entire project is completed in all respects and that the appellant's share of flats were already handed over and that the appellant is making false claims.
7. Vide order dated 18.04.2022, the Court below refused to grant the relief no.1 sought by the appellant and directed the matter to be listed on 20.06.2022 to consider reliefs 2 and 3.
8. Challenging the said decision, this Appeal is preferred.
9. Extensive submissions are made by learned counsel appearing for the appellant and learned counsel appearing for the respondents on various aspects touching upon merits of the claims and cause for inter se disputes. However, the learned counsel for respondents raised preliminary objection on maintainability of Arb.O.P.No.5 of 2022 in the Court of XVI Additional District and Sessions Judge, Malkajgiri. 9.1. According to learned counsel, inter se dispute is a commercial dispute and all matters arising out of commercial transactions should be PNR,J & SSRN,J CMA No.270 OF 2022 filed before the Commercial Court only and the ordinary Civil Court has no jurisdiction. Learned counsel has taken us through the definition in Section 2(1)(c)(vii), provisions in Sections 10 and 12 of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 (for short, Act, 2015).
9.2. Learned counsel pointed out that issue of maintainability ought to have been considered as a preliminary issue before going into the merits.
10. Per contra, according to learned counsel for appellant, not all contracts are commercial in nature and only such of those disputes which are commercial in nature alone have to be resolved by the commercial Court. That, in the instant case, it was only a development agreement and project is not completed, commercial activity has not commenced and property is not put to use, therefore the dispute involved inter se is not a commercial dispute and A.O.P is maintainable before the Civil Court. In support of said contention, learned counsel for appellant placed reliance on decision of the Supreme Court in Ambalal Sarabhai Enterprises Limited Vs. K.S. Infraspace LLP and another .
11. As the issue of application of Commercial Courts Act, 2015 goes to the root of the matter, the Court has taken up the same as a preliminary issue.
(2020) 15 SCC 585 PNR,J & SSRN,J CMA No.270 OF 2022
12. Section 2(1)(c) of the Act, 2015 defines what is meant by 'commercial dispute' and instances are mentioned in various clauses incorporated therein. In so far as this case is concerned, 'commercial dispute' means a dispute arising out of agreements relating to immovable property used exclusively in trade or commerce [Section 2(1)(c)(vii)2]. Thus, a dispute arising out of agreement relating to a property is a commercial dispute, if such immovable property is used exclusively for trade or commerce.
13. According to Section 10(3) of the Act, 2015, if subject matter of an arbitration is a 'commercial dispute' of a 'specified value', all applications or appeals arising out of arbitration clause of contract filed under the provisions of the Act, 1996 would ordinarily lie before any principal civil Court of original jurisdiction in a district and heard and disposed of by the Commercial Court exercising territorial jurisdiction over such arbitration where such Commercial Court has been constituted. Section 12 prescribes mechanism to determine what is 'specified value'.
14. On a cumulative reading of Section 2(1)(c)(vii), Section 103 and Section 124, it is apparent that if a dispute arising out of an agreement Section 2. Definitions.-- (1) In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires, -- (a) & (b) xxx
(c) "commercial dispute" means a dispute arising out of -- (i) to (vi) xxxx
(vii) agreements relating to immovable property used exclusively in trade or commerce;
10. Jurisdiction in respect of arbitration matters.--Where the subject-matter of an arbitration is a commercial dispute of a Specified Value and--
(1) If such arbitration is an international commercial arbitration, all applications or appeals arising out of such arbitration under the provisions of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (26 of 1996) that have been filed in a High Court, shall be heard and disposed of by the Commercial Division where such Commercial Division has been constituted in such High Court.
PNR,J & SSRN,J CMA No.270 OF 2022 concerning immovable property which is exclusively used in trade or commerce and whose 'specified value' is more than one crore, then, it is a 'commercial dispute' and only the commercial Court has jurisdiction to deal with application filed under Section 9 of the Act, 1996.
15. In this backdrop of statutory scheme, it is necessary to ascertain whether the property is already put to use. The developer obtained building permission from GHMC on 03.12.2016 to construct multistoried apartments building. The developer obtained Occupancy Certificate on 18.12.2020, which is issued after construction of a building and mortgaged flats were also released. On 26.03.2021 the purchasers complained that even though few purchasers are living till water connection and electricity are pending and quality is not maintained. On 13.07.2021 the appellant acknowledged receipt of keys of apartments (2) If such arbitration is other than an international commercial arbitration, all applications or appeals arising out of such arbitration under the provisions of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (26 of 1996) that have been filed on the original side of the High Court, shall be heard and disposed of by the Commercial Division where such Commercial Division has been constituted in such High Court.
(3) If such arbitration is other than an international commercial arbitration, all applications or appeals arising out of such arbitration under the provisions of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (26 of 1996) that would ordinarily lie before any principal civil court of original jurisdiction in a district (not being a High Court) shall be filed in, and heard and disposed of by the Commercial Court exercising territorial jurisdiction over such arbitration where such Commercial Court has been constituted.
12. Determination of Specified Value.--(1) The Specified Value of the subject-matter of the commercial dispute in a suit, appeal or application shall be determined in the following manner:--
(a) where the relief sought in a suit or application is for recovery of money, the money sought to be recovered in the suit or application inclusive of interest, if any, computed up to the date of filing of the suit or application, as the case may be, shall be taken into account for determining such Specified Value;
(b) where the relief sought in a suit, appeal or application relates to movable property or to a right therein, the market value of the movable property as on the date of filing of the suit, appeal or application, as the case may be, shall be taken into account for determining such Specified Value;
(c) where the relief sought in a suit, appeal or application relates to immovable property or to a right therein, the market value of the immovable property, as on the date of filing of the suit, appeal or application, as the case may be, shall be taken into account for determining Specified Value; 1[and] (d) where the relief sought in a suit, appeal or application relates to any other intangible right, the market value of the said rights as estimated by the plaintiff shall be taken into account for determining Specified Value; 2* * *3* * * * * (2) The aggregate value of the claim and counterclaim, if any as set out in the statement of claim and the counterclaim, if any, in an arbitration of a commercial dispute shall be the basis for determining whether such arbitration is subject to the jurisdiction of a Commercial Division, Commercial Appellate Division or Commercial Court, as the case may be. (3) No appeal or civil revision application under section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908), as the case may be, shall lie from an order of a Commercial Division or Commercial Court finding that it has jurisdiction to hear a commercial dispute under this Act.
PNR,J & SSRN,J CMA No.270 OF 2022 mentioned in their letter dated 13.07.2021 (page 226 of the appeal paper book) showing taking possession of those apartments. A day later the appellant complained that lot of work is pending and listed out works required to be attended. There has been exchange of correspondence between the owner and developer on various aspects of development of the property. All this clearly point out that the property is no more open land, but land was put to use by constructing multistoried apartment building and some families are living.
16. To contend that subject land is 'not put to use'/'not actually used' therefore, Commercial Court has no jurisdiction, learned counsel for respondents placed reliance on the decision of Hon'ble Supreme Court in Ambarlal Sarabhai Enterprises Ltd., (supra). We have carefully gone through the said decision. The decision concerns immovable property which was not actually used/put to use for commercial purposes.
17. There is no quarrel with the proposition of law on scope of Section 2(1)(c)(vii). But looking at the facts of the case, on hand, it is seen that the suit schedule land was already 'put to use' / 'used' for commercial purpose. The apartments are constructed. Owner's share of the apartments was handed over. Some flats were sold and being occupied. Thus, the subject land was already put to 'use'/ 'actual use' for commercial purposes and therefore the definition of 'commercial dispute' as PNR,J & SSRN,J CMA No.270 OF 2022 incorporated in Section 2(1)(c)(vii) of the Act, 2015 is attracted in the instant case.
18. It is not in dispute that 1,00,00,000/- was paid by the developer as security deposit. The arrears of rent claimed by appellant was more than 3,00,00,000/-. The entire development activity runs into crores of rupees. Therefore, the 'specified value' of the subject dispute is more than one crore. In view of specific provision in Section 10 read with Section 12 of the Act, 2015, application under Section 9 of the Act, 1996 has to be filed in a designated Commercial Court only and Civil Court has no jurisdiction to deal with such applications.
19. In the result, Appeal is disposed of. It is held that Arb.O.P.No.5 of 2022 is not maintainable before civil Court. As Arb.O.P., is not maintainable before the Civil Court, the appellant is not entitled to any relief.
20. As the preliminary issue on jurisdiction is answered, there is no expression of opinion on merits. All issues are left open to be urged in appropriate proceedings. It is made clear that it is open to appellant to withdraw the Arb.O.P.No.5 of 2022 pending in the Court of XVI Additional District and Sessions Judge, Malkajgiri, old Ranga Reddy District presently Medchal Malkajgiri district. It is open to appellant to avail PNR,J & SSRN,J CMA No.270 OF 2022 appropriate remedy that may be available under the Commercial Courts Act, 2015. Pending miscellaneous applications, if any, stand closed.
