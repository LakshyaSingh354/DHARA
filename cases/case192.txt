                                   -2-



                             JUDGMENT
This appeal is directed against the impugned judgment and order dated 25.10.2021 passed in COM.A.S.62/2019 by the LXXXV Additional City Civil Judge (Commercial court), Bengaluru, whereby the said suit filed by the appellant - plaintiff against the respondent -
defendant under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (for short 'the said Act of 1996') was dismissed by the Commercial court, thereby, confirming the impugned award dated 30.12.2018 passed in ICA/BAN 1 OF 2013 by the Arbitral Tribunal (sole arbitrator) before the Arbitration and Conciliation Centre, Bengaluru (Domestic and International).
2. Heard the learned Senior counsel for appellant and the learned Additional Government Advocate for the respondent and perused the material on record.
3. The material on record discloses that the appellant
- claimant filed a claim petition before the Arbitral Tribunal putting forth various monetary claims against the respondent under various heads, in all, amounting to a sum of Rs.560,86,85,717/- towards losses suffered by the appellant - claimant together with interest and for other reliefs. The details of the claims put forth by the appellant as detailed in the claim petition are as under:-
           CLAIMS    AMOUNT IN RS.      INTEREST IN RS.
             A          19,71,81,195        14,53,00,142

             I          50,00,00,000                 NIL

      4.    Before    the   Arbitral   Tribunal,   the   respondent
appeared and contested the claim and filed its statement of defence, to which the appellant - claimant filed its rejoinder, pursuant to which, both sides adduced oral and documentary evidence. After hearing the parties, the Tribunal allowed the claims of the appellant in part as hereunder;
       CLAIMS        AMOUNT IN RS.       INTEREST IN RS.
          A             16,13,23,938        18,39,12,704

5. Aggrieved by the impugned award passed by the Arbitral Tribunal insofar as it related to rejecting the claim of the appellant in full in respect of claims F, G, and H and allowing the same only in part in respect of claims D, E and I, the appellant herein filed the aforesaid suit against the respondent herein under Section 34 of the said Act of 1996.
6. So also, the respondent also filed an arbitration suit in A.S.No.57/2019. The said suit was dismissed by the Commercial court vide judgment and order dated 25.10.2021. Learned Additional Government Advocate appearing for the respondent submitted that the respondent has not challenged the aforesaid judgment and order dated 25.10.2021 passed in A.S.No.57/2019 and consequently, the same has attained finality and as such, the arbitral award has attained finality insofar as the respondent is concerned.
7. The suit in Commercial A.S.No.62/2019 was contested by the respondent herein. By the impugned judgment and order, the commercial court dismissed the said suit filed by the appellant herein thereby confirming the arbitral award. Aggrieved by the impugned arbitral award as well as the impugned judgment and order of the commercial court passed in Commercial A.S.No.62/2019, the appellant is before this Court by way of the present appeal.
8. In addition to reiterating the various contentions urged in the appeal and referring to the material on record, learned Senior counsel for the appellant submitted that the commercial court failed to appreciate that the appellant was entitled to the entire amounts put forth in claims - D, E, F, G, H and I by him; that the reasoning and findings recorded by the Arbitral Tribunal and confirmed by the commercial court which allowed the said claims only partly and rejected the remaining portions / part of the said claims were patently illegal and erroneous and without properly considering or appreciating the material on record. It was also contended that the arbitral award contained several patent illegalities and that the same was in contravention of the fundamental policy of the Indian law apart from being opposed to principles of morality and justice and contrary to public policy. It is therefore contended that the impugned arbitral award as well as the impugned judgment and order of the commercial court deserve to be set aside.
9. Per contra, learned Additional Government Advocate for the respondent submits that there is no merit in the appeal and having regard to the limited and restricted scope of interference under Sections 34 and 37 of the said Act of 1996, there is no merit in the appeal and the same is liable to be dismissed.
10. A perusal of the arbitral award will indicate that the Arbitral Tribunal has partly allowed the claim of the appellant in respect of claims D, E, and I and has rejected claims F, G and H. In this context, the details of the said claims are as under:
I. Claim 'D' - This claim relates to the loss of profit said to have been suffered by the appellant on account of the respondent illegally restraining the MSPCs from procuring raw materials from the claimant, which has been quantified at 10% amounting to Rs.168,67,00,000/-; as against this amount claimed by the appellant, the Arbitral Tribunal awarded Rs. 39,74,68,000/-.
II. Claim 'E' - This claim relates to the compensation sought for by the appellant for the loss caused to the appellant on account of illegal termination of the agreements by the respondent, which has been quantified as Rs.64,36,93,378/-; as against this amount claimed by the appellant, the Arbitral Tribunal awarded Rs.16,00,00,000/-.
III. Claim 'I' - This claim relates to the compensation sought for by the appellant on account of loss of reputation and mental agony and harassment due to illegal termination by the respondent, which has been quantified as Rs.50,00,00,000/-; as against this amount claimed by the appellant, Arbitral Tribunal awarded Rs.10,00,00,000/-.
IV. Claim 'F' - This claim relates to the claim for compensation put forth by the appellant towards alleged loss sustained by it due to illegal termination of its contracts by the appellant resulting in failure on the part of the appellant to obtain the tenders and earn profit which has been quantified as Rs.10,30,00,000/-; this claim was rejected by the Arbitral Tribunal.
V. Claim 'G' - This claim relates to the claim for compensation put forth by the appellant towards alleged loss sustained by it due to illegal termination of its contracts by the appellant resulting in failure on the part of the appellant to obtain the tenders and earn profit which has been quantified as Rs.31,40,00,000/-; this claim was rejected by the Arbitral Tribunal.
VI. Claim 'H' - This claim relates to the claim for compensation put forth by the appellant towards alleged loss sustained by it due to illegal termination of its contracts by the appellant resulting in failure on the part of the appellant to obtain the tenders and earn profit which has been quantified as Rs.1335 crores; this claim was rejected by the Arbitral Tribunal.
11. The question with regard to the limited scope of interference under Section 34 of the said Act of 1996 is no longer res integra; the Apex Court as well as this Court has repeatedly held that the Court dealing with Section 34 application / petition does not act like an appellate court and cannot be re-appreciate / re-evaluate evidence on the merits of the matter and arrive at a different conclusion than that of the Arbitral Tribunal in view of the scheme of the said Act of 1996.
12. In the case of South East Asia Marine Engineering Constructions Limited Vs. Oil India Limited reported in (2020) 5 SCC 164, a three Judge Bench of the Apex Court held as under:
12. It is a settled position that a court can set aside the award only on the grounds as provided in the Arbitration Act as interpreted by the courts. Recently, this Court in Dyna Technologies (P) Ltd. v. Crompton Greaves Ltd. [Dyna Technologies (P) Ltd. v. Crompton Greaves Ltd., (2019) 20 SCC 1 : 2019 SCC OnLine SC 1656] laid down the scope of such interference. This Court observed as follows : (SCC pp. 11-12, para 24) "24. There is no dispute that Section 34 of the Arbitration Act limits a challenge to an award only on the grounds provided therein or as interpreted by various Courts. We need to be cognizant of the fact that arbitral awards should not be interfered with in a casual and cavalier manner, unless the Court comes to a conclusion that the perversity of the award goes to the root of the matter without there being a possibility of alternative interpretation which may sustain the arbitral award. Section 34 is different in its approach and cannot be equated with a normal appellate jurisdiction. The mandate under Section 34 is to respect the finality of the arbitral award and the party autonomy to get their dispute adjudicated by an alternative forum as provided under the law. If the Courts were to interfere with the arbitral award in the usual course on factual aspects, then the commercial wisdom behind opting for alternate dispute resolution would stand frustrated."
13. It is also settled law that where two views are possible, the Court cannot interfere in the plausible view taken by the arbitrator supported by reasoning. This Court in Dyna Technologies [Dyna Technologies (P) Ltd. v. Crompton Greaves Ltd., (2019) 20 SCC 1 : 2019 SCC OnLine SC 1656] observed as under : (SCC p. 12, para 25) "25. Moreover, umpteen number of judgments of this Court have categorically held that the Courts should not interfere with an award merely because an alternative view on facts and interpretation of contract exists. The Courts need to be cautious and should defer to the view taken by the Arbitral Tribunal even if the reasoning provided in the award is implied unless such award portrays perversity unpardonable under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act."
14. However, the question in the present case is whether the interpretation provided to the contract in the award of the Tribunal was reasonable and fair, so that the
- 10 -
same passes the muster under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act?
15. In the present case, the respondent has argued that the view taken by the Arbitral Tribunal was not even a possible interpretation, therefore the award being unreasonable and unfair suffers from perversity. Hence, the respondent has pleaded that the award ought to be set aside. In this context, we may state that usually the Court is not required to examine the merits of the interpretation provided in the award by the arbitrator, if it comes to a conclusion that such an interpretation was reasonably possible.
13. In the case of Project Director Vs. M. Hakeem and another reported in (2021) 9 SCC 1, it was held as under:
22. Thus, under the scheme of the old Act, an award may be remitted, modified or otherwise set aside given the grounds contained in Section 30 of the 1940 Act, which are broader than the grounds contained in Section 34 of the 1996 Act.
23. It is settled law that a Section 34 proceeding does not contain any challenge on the merits of the award.
This has been decided in MMTC Ltd. v. Vedanta Ltd. [MMTC Ltd. v. Vedanta Ltd., (2019) 4 SCC 163 :
(2019) 2 SCC (Civ) 293] , as follows : (SCC p. 167, para
14)
"14. As far as interference with an order made under Section 34, as per Section 37, is concerned, it cannot be disputed that such
- 11 -
interference under Section 37 cannot travel beyond the restrictions laid down under Section
34. In other words, the court cannot undertake an independent assessment of the merits of the award, and must only ascertain that the exercise of power by the court under Section 34 has not exceeded the scope of the provision. Thus, it is evident that in case an arbitral award has been confirmed by the court under Section 34 and by the court in an appeal under Section 37, this Court must be extremely cautious and slow to disturb such concurrent findings."
24. Likewise, in Ssangyong Engg. & Construction Co. Ltd. v. NHAI [Ssangyong Engg. & Construction Co. Ltd. v. NHAI, (2019) 15 SCC 131 : (2020) 2 SCC (Civ) 213] , this Court under the caption "Section 34(2)(a) does not entail a challenge to an arbitral award on merits"
referred to this Court's judgment in Renusagar Power Co. Ltd. v. General Electric Co. [Renusagar Power Co. Ltd. v. General Electric Co., 1994 Supp (1) SCC 644] , the Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, 1958 ("the New York Convention") and various other authorities to conclude that there could be no challenge on merits under the grounds mentioned in Section 34 -- (see paras 34 to 48). This Court also held, in Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Co. Ltd. v. Datar Switchgear Ltd. [Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Co. Ltd. v. Datar Switchgear Ltd., (2018) 3 SCC 133 : (2018) 2 SCC (Civ) 65] (at p. 170), that the court hearing a Section 34 petition does not sit in appeal (see para 51).
- 12 -
25. As a matter of fact, the point raised in the appeals stands concluded in McDermott International Inc. v. Burn Standard Co. Ltd. [McDermott International Inc. v. Burn Standard Co. Ltd., (2006) 11 SCC 181] , where this Court held : (SCC p. 208, paras 51-52) "51. After the 1996 Act came into force, under Section 16 of the Act the party questioning the jurisdiction of the arbitrator has an obligation to raise the said question before the arbitrator. Such a question of jurisdiction could be raised if it is beyond the scope of his authority. It was required to be raised during arbitration proceedings or soon after initiation thereof. The jurisdictional question is required to be determined as a preliminary ground. A decision taken thereupon by the arbitrator would be the subject-matter of challenge under Section 34 of the Act. In the event the arbitrator opined that he had no jurisdiction in relation thereto an appeal thereagainst was provided for under Section 37 of the Act.
52. The 1996 Act makes provision for the supervisory role of courts, for the review of the arbitral award only to ensure fairness. Intervention of the court is envisaged in few circumstances only, like, in case of fraud or bias by the arbitrators, violation of natural justice, etc. The court cannot correct errors of the arbitrators. It can only quash the award leaving the parties free to begin the arbitration again if it is desired. So, the scheme of the provision aims at keeping the supervisory role of the court at minimum
- 13 -
level and this can be justified as parties to the agreement make a conscious decision to exclude the court's jurisdiction by opting for arbitration as they prefer the expediency and finality offered by it."
26. This statement of the law was followed in Kinnari Mullick v. Ghanshyam Das Damani [Kinnari Mullick v. Ghanshyam Das Damani, (2018) 11 SCC 328 :
(2018) 5 SCC (Civ) 106] at p. 334 (see para 15).
27. Also, in Dyna Technologies (P) Ltd. v. Crompton Greaves Ltd. [Dyna Technologies (P) Ltd. v. Crompton Greaves Ltd., (2019) 20 SCC 1] , this Court held : (SCC p. 15, paras 36-37) "36. At this juncture it must be noted that the legislative intention of providing Section 34(4) in the Arbitration Act was to make the award enforceable, after giving an opportunity to the Tribunal to undo the curable defects. This provision cannot be brushed aside and the High Court [Crompton Greaves Ltd. v. Dyna Technologies (P) Ltd., 2007 SCC OnLine Mad 427] could not have proceeded further to determine the issue on merits.
37. In case of absence of reasoning the utility has been provided under Section 34(4) of the Arbitration Act to cure such defects. When there is complete perversity in the reasoning then only it can be challenged under the provisions of Section 34 of the Arbitration Act. The power vested under Section 34(4) of the Arbitration Act to cure defects can be utilised in cases where the
- 14 -
arbitral award does not provide any reasoning or if the award has some gap in the reasoning or otherwise and that can be cured so as to avoid a challenge based on the aforesaid curable defects under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act. However, in this case such remand to the Tribunal would not be beneficial as this case has taken more than 25 years for its adjudication. It is in this state of affairs that we lament that the purpose of arbitration as an effective and expeditious forum itself stands effaced."
28. Some of the judgments of the High Courts are also instructive. A learned Single Judge of the Delhi High Court in Cybernetics Network (P) Ltd. v. Bisquare Technologies (P) Ltd. [Cybernetics Network (P) Ltd. v. Bisquare Technologies (P) Ltd., 2012 SCC OnLine Del 1155] , held : (SCC OnLine Del paras 47-51) "47. The next question that arises is whether the above claims as mentioned in para 44 that have been erroneously rejected by the learned arbitrator can be allowed by this Court in exercise of its powers under Section 34(4) of the Act?
48. Under Section 34(4) of the Act, the Court while deciding a challenge to an arbitral award, can either 'adjourn the proceedings for a period of time determined by it in order to give the Arbitral Tribunal an opportunity to resume the arbitral proceedings or to take such other action as in the opinion of the Arbitral Tribunal will eliminate the grounds for setting aside the arbitral award'. This necessarily envisages the
- 15 -
Court having to remit the matter to the Arbitral Tribunal. This is subject to the Court finding it appropriate to do so and a party requesting it to do so.
49. In Union of India v. Arctic India [Union of India v. Arctic India, 2007 SCC OnLine Bom 409 :
(2007) 4 Arb LR 524] , a learned Single Judge of the Bombay High Court opined that the Court can modify the award even if there is no express provision in the Act permitting it. The Court followed the decision of the Supreme Court in Krishna Bhagya Jala Nigam Ltd. v. Harischandra Reddy [Krishna Bhagya Jala Nigam Ltd. v. Harischandra Reddy, (2007) 2 SCC 720] . A similar view has been taken by a learned Single Judge of this Court in Union of India v. Modern Laminators Ltd. [Union of India v. Modern Laminators Ltd., 2008 SCC OnLine Del 956 : (2008) 3 Arb LR 489] There the question was whether in light of the arbitrator having failed to decide the counterclaim of the respondent in that case the Court could itself decide the counterclaim. After discussing the case law, the Court concluded that it could modify the award but only to a limited extent. It held (Arb LR p. 496) : (Modern Laminators Ltd. case [Union of India v. Modern Laminators Ltd., 2008 SCC OnLine Del 956 : (2008) 3 Arb LR 489] , SCC OnLine Del para 22) '22. ... Such modification of award will be a species of "setting aside" only and would be "setting aside to a limited extent". However, if the
- 16 -
courts were to find that they cannot within the confines of interference permissible or on the material before the arbitrator are unable to modify and if the same would include further fact finding or adjudication of intricate questions of law, the parties ought to be left to the forum of their choice i.e. to be relegated under Section 34(4) of the Act to further arbitration or other civil remedies.'
50. However, none of the above decisions categorically hold that where certain claims have been erroneously rejected by the arbitrator, the Court can in exercise of its powers under Section 34(4) of the Act itself decide those claims. The Allahabad High Court has in U.P. State Handloom Corpn. Ltd. v. Asha Lata Talwar [U.P. State Handloom Corpn. Ltd. v. Asha Lata Talwar, 2009 SCC OnLine All 624 : (2009) 4 All LJ 397] , held that while exercising the powers to set aside an award under Section 34 of the Act the Court does not have the jurisdiction to grant the original relief which was prayed for before the arbitrator. The Allahabad High Court referred to the decision of the Supreme Court in McDermott International Inc. v. Burn Standard Co. Ltd. [McDermott International Inc. v. Burn Standard Co. Ltd., (2006) 11 SCC 181] , where it was observed (SCC p. 208):
***
51. The view of the Allahabad High Court in U.P. State Handloom Corpn. Ltd. v. Asha Lata Talwar [U.P. State Handloom Corpn. Ltd. v. Asha
- 17 -
Lata Talwar, 2009 SCC OnLine All 624 : (2009) 4 All LJ 397] appears to be consistent with the scheme of the Act, and in particular Section 34 thereof which is a departure from the scheme of Section 16 of the 1940 Act which perhaps gave the Court a wider amplitude of powers. Under Section 34(2) of the Act, the Court is empowered to set aside an arbitral award on the grounds specified therein. The remand to the arbitrator under Section 34(4) is to a limited extent of requiring the Arbitral Tribunal 'to eliminate the grounds for setting aside the arbitral award'. There is no specific power granted to the court to itself allow the claims originally made before the Arbitral Tribunal where it finds the Arbitral Tribunal erred in rejecting such claims. If such a power is recognised as falling within the ambit of Section 34(4) of the Act, then the court will be acting no different from an appellate court which would be contrary to the legislative intent behind Section 34 of the Act. Accordingly, this Court declines to itself decide the claims of CNPL that have been wrongly rejected by the learned arbitrator."
29. The Delhi High Court in Nussli Switzerland Ltd. v. Organizing Committee, Commonwealth Games, 2010 [Nussli Switzerland Ltd. v. Organizing Committee, Commonwealth Games, 2010, 2014 SCC OnLine Del 4834] , held : (SCC OnLine Del para 34) "34. A party like the Organising Committee which has its claims rejected, except a part, but which subsumes into the larger amount awarded
- 18 -
in favour of the opposite party, even if succeeds in the objections to the award would at best have the award set aside for the reason the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 as distinct from the power of the court under the Arbitration Act, 1940, does not empower the court to modify an award. If a claim which has been rejected by an Arbitral Tribunal is found to be faulty, the court seized of the objections under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 has to set aside the award and leave the matter at that. It would be open to the party concerned to commence fresh proceedings (including arbitration) and for this view one may for purposes of convenience refer to sub-section (4) of Section 43 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. It reads:
'43. Limitations.--(1)-
(3) * * * (4) Where the Court orders that an arbitral award be set aside, the period between the commencement of the arbitration and the date of the order of the Court shall be excluded in computing the time prescribed by the Limitation Act, 1963 (36 of 1963), for the commencement of the proceedings (including arbitration) with respect to the dispute so submitted.' "
30. An instructive judgment of the Delhi High Court in Puri Construction (P) Ltd. v. Larsen & Toubro Ltd. [Puri Construction (P) Ltd. v. Larsen & Toubro Ltd., 2015 SCC OnLine Del 9126] deals with the authorities of the Madras
- 19 -
and Calcutta High Courts on the one hand and the other High Courts dealing with this problem as follows : (SCC OnLine Del paras 115-16 & 118) "115. In these circumstances, this Court holds that the reliefs granted by the Tribunal cannot be sustained and are hereby set aside. The question that follows is whether this Court, exercising jurisdiction under Section 37 read with Section 34 of the Act, can modify, vary or remit the award. At the outset, it is noticed that there are divergent views on this issue. Here, the Court notices a somewhat divergent approach of various High Courts. The case law is discussed in the following part of the judgment.
Authorities in Favour of the Power to Modify, Vary or Remit the award
116. A learned Single Judge of this Court in Bhasin Associates v. N.B.C.C. [Bhasin Associates v. N.B.C.C., 2005 SCC OnLine Del 689 : ILR (2005) 2 Del 88] held that 'the power to set aside an award when exercised by the court would leave a vacuum if the said power was not understood to include the power to remand the matter back to the arbitrator'. This view was subsequently adopted in Single Bench decisions in Union of India v. Modern Laminators Ltd. [Union of India v. Modern Laminators Ltd., 2008 SCC OnLine Del 956 : (2008) 3 Arb LR 489] (in the context of modification of the award), IFFCO-Tokio General Insurance Co.
Ltd. v. Indo-Rama Synthetics Ltd. [IFFCO-Tokio General Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Indo-Rama
- 20 -
Synthetics Ltd., 2015 SCC OnLine Del 6669] (decided on 20-1-2015) and Canara Bank v. BSNL [Canara Bank v. BSNL, 2015 SCC OnLine Del 8379] (decided on 26-3-2015). In Modern Laminators [Union of India v. Modern Laminators Ltd., 2008 SCC OnLine Del 956 :
(2008) 3 Arb LR 489] , the Court relied upon the Supreme Court's decision in Numaligarh Refinery Ltd. v. Daelim Industrial Co. Ltd. [Numaligarh Refinery Ltd. v. Daelim Industrial Co. Ltd., (2007) 8 SCC 466] , noting that the Court therein had modified the award in terms of its findings; and the decision in Krishna Bhagya Jala Nigam Ltd. v. G. Harischandra Reddy [Krishna Bhagya Jala Nigam Ltd. v. Harischandra Reddy, (2007) 2 SCC 720] , where the interest rate awarded by the arbitrator was modified. The learned Single Judge in Canara Bank relied upon a decision of a Single Judge of the Madras High Court in Gayatri Balaswamy v. ISG Novasoft Technologies Ltd. [Gayatri Balaswamy v. ISG Novasoft Technologies Ltd., 2014 SCC OnLine Mad 6568 :
(2015) 1 Mad LJ 5] The Court in Gayatri Balaswamy [Gayatri Balaswamy v. ISG Novasoft Technologies Ltd., 2014 SCC OnLine Mad 6568 : (2015) 1 Mad LJ 5] examined the issue in significant [sic] and held as follows : (Gayatri Balaswamy case [Gayatri Balaswamy v. ISG Novasoft Technologies Ltd., 2014 SCC OnLine Mad 6568 : (2015) 1 Mad LJ 5] , SCC OnLine Mad para 52)

'52. Therefore, in my considered view, the expression "recourse to a court against an arbitral award" appearing in Section 34(1) cannot be construed to mean only a right to seek the setting aside of an award. Recourse against an arbitral award could be either for setting aside or for modifying or for enhancing or for varying or for revising an award. The expression "application for setting aside such an award" appearing in Sections 34(2) and (3) merely prescribes the form, in which, a person can seek recourse against an arbitral award. The form, in which an application has to be made, cannot curtail the substantial right conferred by the statute. In other words, the right to have recourse to a court, is a substantial right and that right is not liable to be curtailed, by the form in which the right has to be enforced or exercised. Hence, in my considered view, the power under Section 34(1) includes, within its ambit, the power to modify, vary or revise.' The same view had been adopted earlier by Single Bench decisions of the Bombay High Court in Axios Navigation Co. Ltd. v. Indian Oil Corpn. Ltd. [Axios Navigation Co. Ltd. v. Indian Oil Corpn. Ltd., 2012 SCC OnLine Bom 4 : (2012) 114 (1) Bom LR 392] and Angerlehner Structurals & Civil Engg. Co. v. Municipal Corpn. of Greater Mumbai [Angerlehner Structurals & Civil Engg. Co. v. Municipal Corpn. of Greater Mumbai, 2012 SCC OnLine Bom 1454 : (2013) 7 Bom CR 83] and a Division Bench of the Calcutta High Court

Authorities holding there is no power to Modify, Vary or Remit the award ***
118. This Court is inclined to follow the decisions in Central Warehousing Corpn. [Central Warehousing Corpn. v. A.S.A. Transport, 2007 SCC OnLine Mad 972] , DDA [DDA v. Bhardwaj Bros., 2014 SCC OnLine Del 1581] , State Trading Corpn. of India Ltd. [State Trading Corpn. of India Ltd. v. Toepfer International Asia PTE Ltd., 2014 SCC OnLine Del 3426] , Bharti Cellular Ltd. [Bharti Cellular Ltd. v. Deptt. of Telecommunications, 2012 SCC OnLine Del 4846] , Cybernetics Network (P) Ltd. [Cybernetics Network (P) Ltd. v. Bisquare Technologies (P) Ltd., 2012 SCC OnLine Del 1155] and Asha Talwar [U.P. State Handloom Corpn. Ltd. v. Asha Lata Talwar, 2009 SCC OnLine All 624 : (2009) 4 All LJ 397] . The guiding principle on this issue was laid down by the Supreme Court in McDermott International Inc. [McDermott International Inc. v. Burn Standard Co. Ltd., (2006) 11 SCC 181] , where the Court held :
(McDermott International Inc. case [McDermott International Inc. v. Burn Standard Co. Ltd., (2006) 11 SCC 181] , SCC p. 208, para 52)
- 23 -
'52. The 1996 Act makes provision for the supervisory role of courts, for the review of the arbitral award only to ensure fairness. Intervention of the court is envisaged in few circumstances only, like, in case of fraud or bias by the arbitrators, violation of natural justice, etc. The court cannot correct errors of the arbitrators. It can only quash the award leaving the parties free to begin the arbitration again if it is desired. So, the scheme of the provision aims at keeping the supervisory role of the court at minimum level and this can be justified as parties to the agreement make a conscious decision to exclude the court's jurisdiction by opting for arbitration as they prefer the expediency and finality offered by it.' Although the Madras High Court in Gayatri Balaswamy [Gayatri Balaswamy v. ISG Novasoft Technologies Ltd., 2014 SCC OnLine Mad 6568 :
(2015) 1 Mad LJ 5] appropriately noted that these observations in McDermott International Inc. [McDermott International Inc. v. Burn Standard Co. Ltd., (2006) 11 SCC 181] were not in the context of the specific issue being dealt herewith, this Court is of the opinion that it is determinative of the Court's approach in an enquiry under Section 34 of the Act. Indeed, a court, while modifying or varying the award would be doing nothing else but "correct[ing] the errors of the arbitrators". This is expressly against the diktat ofMcDermottInternational Inc. [McDermott International Inc. v. Burn
- 24 -
Standard Co. Ltd., (2006) 11 SCC 181] Further, if the power to remit the matter to the arbitrator is read into Section 34, it would render inexplicable the deliberate omission by Parliament of a provision analogous to Section 16 of the Arbitration Act, 1940 in the present Act. Section 16 of the 1940 Act specifically armed courts with the power to remit the matter to arbitration. Noticeably, the scope of remission under the present Act is confined to that prescribed in sub- section (4) of Section 34. Besides the Division Bench rulings of this Court in DDA [DDA v. Bhardwaj Bros., 2014 SCC OnLine Del 1581] , State Trading Corpn. of India Ltd. [State Trading Corpn. of India Ltd. v. Toepfer International Asia PTE Ltd., 2014 SCC OnLine Del 3426] , this was also noted by a Full Bench of the Bombay High Court in R.S. Jiwani v. Ircon International Ltd. [R.S. Jiwani v. Ircon International Ltd., 2009 SCC OnLine Bom 2021 :
(2010) 1 Bom CR 529] , where the Court held :
(R.S. Jiwani case [R.S. Jiwani v. Ircon International Ltd., 2009 SCC OnLine Bom 2021 : (2010) 1 Bom CR 529] , SCC OnLine Bom paras 28 & 35) '28. ... An award can only be set aside under the provisions of Section 34 as there is no other provision except Section 33 which permits the Arbitral Tribunal to correct or interpret the award or pass additional award, that too, on limited grounds stated in Section 33. ...
***
- 25 -
35. ... It is also true that there are no pari materia provisions like Sections 15 and 16 of the Act of 1940 in the 1996 Act but still the provisions of Section 34 read together, sufficiently indicate vesting of vast powers in the court to set aside an award and even to adjourn a matter and such acts and deeds by the Arbitral Tribunal at the instance of the party which would help in removing the grounds of attack for setting aside the arbitral award.' On the other hand, the Calcutta High Court in Snehasis Bhowmick [W.B. Electronics Industries Development Corpn. Ltd. v. Snehasis Bhowmick, 2012 SCC OnLine Cal 10262] did not analyse this distinction, or the specific observations of the Supreme Court in McDermott International Inc. [McDermott International Inc. v. Burn Standard Co. Ltd., (2006) 11 SCC 181] quoted above. Further, the decisions in Numaligarh Refinery [Numaligarh Refinery Ltd. v. Daelim Industrial Co. Ltd., (2007) 8 SCC 466] and Harischandra Reddy [Krishna Bhagya Jala Nigam Ltd. v. Harischandra Reddy, (2007) 2 SCC 720] did not discuss the Court's power to modify, vary or remit the award under Section 34 of the Act. Therefore, in light of the dictum in McDermott International Inc. [McDermott International Inc. v. Burn Standard Co. Ltd., (2006) 11 SCC 181] and the difference in provisions of the 1940 Act and the present Act, this Court holds that the power to
- 26 -
modify, vary or remit the award does not exist under Section 34 of the Act."
14. So also, in the case of Delhi Airport Metro Express Private Limited Vs. Delhi Metro Rail Corporation Limited reported in (2022) 1 SCC 131, it was held as under:
28. This Court has in several other judgments interpreted Section 34 of the 1996 Act to stress on the restraint to be shown by Courts while examining the validity of the arbitral awards. The limited grounds available to Courts for annulment of arbitral awards are well known to legally trained minds. However, the difficulty arises in applying the well-established principles for interference to the facts of each case that come up before the Courts. There is a disturbing tendency of Courts setting aside arbitral awards, after dissecting and reassessing factual aspects of the cases to come to a conclusion that the award needs intervention and thereafter, dubbing the award to be vitiated by either perversity or patent illegality, apart from the other grounds available for annulment of the award. This approach would lead to corrosion of the object of the 1996 Act and the endeavours made to preserve this object, which is minimal judicial interference with arbitral awards. That apart, several judicial pronouncements of this Court would become a dead letter if arbitral awards are set aside by categorising them as perverse or patently illegal without appreciating the contours of the said expressions.
- 27 -
29. Patent illegality should be illegality which goes to the root of the matter. In other words, every error of law committed by the Arbitral Tribunal would not fall within the expression "patent illegality". Likewise, erroneous application of law cannot be categorised as patent illegality. In addition, contravention of law not linked to public policy or public interest is beyond the scope of the expression "patent illegality". What is prohibited is for Courts to reappreciate evidence to conclude that the award suffers from patent illegality appearing on the face of the award, as Courts do not sit in appeal against the arbitral award. The permissible grounds for interference with a domestic award under Section 34(2-A) on the ground of patent illegality is when the arbitrator takes a view which is not even a possible one, or interprets a clause in the contract in such a manner which no fair- minded or reasonable person would, or if the arbitrator commits an error of jurisdiction by wandering outside the contract and dealing with matters not allotted to them. An arbitral award stating no reasons for its findings would make itself susceptible to challenge on this account. The conclusions of the arbitrator which are based on no evidence or have been arrived at by ignoring vital evidence are perverse and can be set aside on the ground of patent illegality. Also, consideration of documents which are not supplied to the other party is a facet of perversity falling within the expression "patent illegality".
30. Section 34(2)(b) refers to the other grounds on which a court can set aside an arbitral award. If a dispute which is not capable of settlement by arbitration is the subject-matter of the award or if the award is in conflict
- 28 -
with public policy of India, the award is liable to be set aside. Explanation (1), amended by the 2015 Amendment Act, clarified the expression "public policy of India" and its connotations for the purposes of reviewing arbitral awards. It has been made clear that an award would be in conflict with public policy of India only when it is induced or affected by fraud or corruption or is in violation of Section 75 or Section 81 of the 1996 Act, if it is in contravention with the fundamental policy of Indian law or if it is in conflict with the most basic notions of morality or justice.
31. In Ssangyong [Ssangyong Engg. & Construction Co. Ltd. v. NHAI, (2019) 15 SCC 131 : (2020) 2 SCC (Civ) 213] , this Court held that the meaning of the expression "fundamental policy of Indian law" would be in accordance with the understanding of this Court in Renusagar Power Co. Ltd. v. General Electric Co. [Renusagar Power Co. Ltd. v. General Electric Co., 1994 Supp (1) SCC 644] . In Renusagar [Renusagar Power Co. Ltd. v. General Electric Co., 1994 Supp (1) SCC 644] , this Court observed that violation of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1973, a statute enacted for the "national economic interest", and disregarding the superior Courts in India would be antithetical to the fundamental policy of Indian law. Contravention of a statute not linked to public policy or public interest cannot be a ground to set at naught an arbitral award as being discordant with the fundamental policy of Indian law and neither can it be brought within the confines of "patent illegality" as discussed above. In other words, contravention of a statute only if it is linked to public policy or public interest is cause for setting aside the
- 29 -
award as being at odds with the fundamental policy of Indian law. If an arbitral award shocks the conscience of the court, it can be set aside as being in conflict with the most basic notions of justice. The ground of morality in this context has been interpreted by this Court to encompass awards involving elements of sexual morality, such as prostitution, or awards seeking to validate agreements which are not illegal but would not be enforced given the prevailing mores of the day. [Ssangyong Engg. & Construction Co. Ltd. v. NHAI, (2019) 15 SCC 131 : (2020) 2 SCC (Civ) 213]
15. Similarly, in the case of Wellspun Speciality Solutions Limited Vs. Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited reported in (2022) 2 SCC 382, it was held as under:
22. Before we analyse the award, we need to first ascertain the scope of Section 34 of the Arbitration Act, before the 2015 amendment, which provided for certain specific grounds for challenge. Section 34, as it existed, reads as under:
"34. Application for setting aside arbitral award.--(1) Recourse to a Court against an arbitral award may be made only by an application for setting aside such award in accordance with sub-section (2) and sub-section (3).
(2) An arbitral award may be set aside by the Court only if--
***
- 30 -
(b) the Court finds that--
(i) the subject-matter of the dispute is not capable of settlement by arbitration under the law for the time being in force, or
(ii) the arbitral award is in conflict with the public policy of India."
(emphasis supplied)
23. The limited grounds provided under Section 34 of the Act, has been interpreted by this Court on numerous occasions. In this case at hand, the challenge of award is based on the fact that the same is against the public policy and patent illegality. Public policy as a ground of challenge has always been met with certain scepticism. The phrase "public policy" does not indicate "a catch-all provision" to challenge awards before an appellate forum on infinite grounds. However, the ambit of the same is so diversly interpreted that in some cases, the purpose of limiting the Section 34 jurisdiction is lost. This Court's jurisprudence also shows that Section 34(2)(b) has undergone a lot of churning and continue to evolve. The purpose of Section 34 is to strike a balance between the court's appellate powers and integrity of the arbitral process.
24. The first case, which expounded on the scope of "public policy" was Renusagar Power Co. Ltd. v. General Electric Co. [Renusagar Power Co. Ltd. v. General Electric Co., 1994 Supp (1) SCC 644] , which inter alia provided that a foreign award may not be enforced under the said Act, if the court dealing with the case is satisfied that the enforcement of the award will be contrary to the public policy. After elaborate discussion, the Court arrived at the
- 31 -
conclusion that public policy comprehended in Section 7(1)(b)(ii) of the Foreign Awards (Recognition and Enforcement) Act, 1961 is the "public policy of India" and does not cover the public policy of any other country.
25. For giving meaning to the term "public policy", the Court observed thus : (Renusagar Power case [Renusagar Power Co. Ltd. v. General Electric Co., 1994 Supp (1) SCC 644] , SCC p. 682, para 66) "66. Article V(2)(b) of the New York Convention of 1958 and Section 7(1)(b)(ii) of the Foreign Awards Act do not postulate refusal of recognition and enforcement of a foreign award on the ground that it is contrary to the law of the country of enforcement and the ground of challenge is confined to the recognition and enforcement being contrary to the public policy of the country in which the award is set to be enforced. There is nothing to indicate that the expression "public policy" in Article V(2)(b) of the New York Convention and Section 7(1)(b)(ii) of the Foreign Awards Act is not used in the same sense in which it was used in Article I(c) of the Geneva Convention, 1927 and Section 7(1) of the Protocol and Convention Act, 1937. This would mean that "public policy" in Section 7(1)(b)(ii) has been used in a narrower sense and in order to attract the bar of public policy the enforcement of the award must invoke something more than the violation of the law of India. Since the Foreign Awards Act is concerned with recognition and enforcement of foreign awards which are
- 32 -
governed by the principles of private international law, the expression "public policy" in Section 7(1)(b)(ii) of the Foreign Awards Act must necessarily be construed in the sense the doctrine of public policy is applied in the field of private international law. Applying the said criteria it must be held that the enforcement of a foreign award would be refused on the ground that it is contrary to public policy if such enforcement would be contrary to (i) fundamental policy of Indian law; or (ii) the interests of India; or (iii) justice or morality."
26. In ONGC v. Saw Pipes Ltd. [ONGC v. Saw Pipes Ltd., (2003) 5 SCC 705] , the scope of Section 34 was expanded to include patent illegality as a ground for challenging the award and held as under : (SCC pp. 727- 28 & 744-45, paras 31 & 74) "31. Therefore, in our view, the phrase "public policy of India" used in Section 34 in context is required to be given a wider meaning. It can be stated that the concept of public policy connotes some matter which concerns public good and the public interest. What is for public good or in public interest or what would be injurious or harmful to the public good or public interest has varied from time to time. However, the award which is, on the face of it, patently in violation of statutory provisions cannot be said to be in public interest. Such award/judgment/decision is likely to adversely affect the administration of justice. Hence, in our view in addition to narrower
- 33 -
meaning given to the term "public policy"
in Renusagar case [Renusagar Power Co. Ltd. v. General Electric Co., 1994 Supp (1) SCC 644] it is required to be held that the award could be set aside if it is patently illegal. The result would be--award could be set aside if it is contrary to:
(a) fundamental policy of Indian law; or
(b) the interest of India; or
(c) justice or morality, or
(d) in addition, if it is patently illegal.
Illegality must go to the root of the matter and if the illegality is of trivial nature it cannot be held that award is against the public policy. Award could also be set aside if it is so unfair and unreasonable that it shocks the conscience of the court. Such award is opposed to public policy and is required to be adjudged void.
***
74. In the result, it is held that:
(A)(1) The court can set aside the arbitral award under Section 34(2) of the Act if the party making the application furnishes proof that:
(i) a party was under some incapacity, or
(ii) the arbitration agreement is not valid under the law to which the parties have subjected it or, failing any indication thereon, under the law for the time being in force; or
- 34 -
(iii) the party making the application was not given proper notice of the appointment of an arbitrator or of the arbitral proceedings or was otherwise unable to present his case; or
(iv) the arbitral award deals with a dispute not contemplated by or not falling within the terms of the submission to arbitration, or it contains decisions on matters beyond the scope of the submission to arbitration.
(2) The court may set aside the award:
(i)(a) if the composition of the Arbitral Tribunal was not in accordance with the agreement of the parties,
(b) failing such agreement, the composition of the Arbitral Tribunal was not in accordance with Part I of the Act.
(ii) if the arbitral procedure was not in accordance with:
(a) the agreement of the parties, or
(b) failing such agreement, the arbitral procedure was not in accordance with Part I of the Act.
However, exception for setting aside the award on the ground of composition of Arbitral Tribunal or illegality of arbitral procedure is that the agreement should not be in conflict with the provisions of Part I
- 35 -
of the Act from which parties cannot derogate.
(c) If the award passed by the Arbitral Tribunal is in contravention of the provisions of the Act or any other substantive law governing the parties or is against the terms of the contract.
(3) The award could be set aside if it is against the public policy of India, that is to say, if it is contrary to:
(a) fundamental policy of Indian law; or
(b) the interest of India; or
(c) justice or morality; or
(d) if it is patently illegal.
(4) It could be challenged:
(a) as provided under Section 13(5); and
(b) Section 16(6) of the Act."
27. Eventually, a three-Judge Bench in ONGC v. Western Geco International Ltd. [ONGC v. Western Geco International Ltd., (2014) 9 SCC 263 : (2014) 5 SCC (Civ) 12] , while upholding Saw Pipes case [ONGC v. Saw Pipes Ltd., (2003) 5 SCC 705] , noted that "illegality" of the award must go to root of the matter. Illegality of a trivial nature could not be held to violate the public policy.
28. In Dyna Technologies (P) Ltd. v. Crompton Greaves Ltd. [Dyna Technologies (P) Ltd. v. Crompton Greaves Ltd., (2019) 20 SCC 1] , this Court held : (SCC p. 12, paras 24-25)
- 36 -
"24. There is no dispute that Section 34 of the Arbitration Act limits a challenge to an award only on the grounds provided therein or as interpreted by various Courts. We need to be cognizant of the fact that arbitral awards should not be interfered with in a casual and cavalier manner, unless the Court comes to a conclusion that the perversity of the award goes to the root of the matter without there being a possibility of alternative interpretation which may sustain the arbitral award. Section 34 is different in its approach and cannot be equated with a normal appellate jurisdiction. The mandate under Section 34 is to respect the finality of the arbitral award and the party autonomy to get their dispute adjudicated by an alternative forum as provided under the law. If the Courts were to interfere with the arbitral award in the usual course on factual aspects, then the commercial wisdom behind opting for alternate dispute resolution would stand frustrated.
25. Moreover, umpteen number of judgments of this Court have categorically held that the Courts should not interfere with an award merely because an alternative view on facts and interpretation of contract exists. The Courts need to be cautious and should defer to the view taken by the Arbitral Tribunal even if the reasoning provided in the award is implied unless such award portrays perversity unpardonable under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act."
- 37 -
16. In the case of U.H.L. Power Company Limited Vs. State of Himachal Pradesh reported in (2022) SCC ONLINE SC 19, the limited and narrow scope of Section 34 of the said Act of 1996 was reiterated by another three Judge Bench of the Apex Court as under:
16. As it is, the jurisdiction conferred on Courts under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act is fairly narrow, when it comes to the scope of an appeal under Section 37 of the Arbitration Act, the jurisdiction of an Appellate Court in examining an order, setting aside or refusing to set aside an award, is all the more circumscribed. In MMTC Limited v. Vedanta Limited7, the reasons for vesting such a limited jurisdiction on the High Court in exercise of powers under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act has been explained in the following words:
"11. As far as Section 34 is concerned, the position is well-settled by now that the Court does not sit in appeal over the arbitral award and may interfere on merits on the limited ground provided under Section 34(2)(b)(ii) i.e. if the award is against the public policy of India. As per the legal position clarified through decisions of this Court prior to the amendments to the 1996 Act in 2015, a violation of Indian public policy, in turn, includes a violation of the fundamental policy of Indian law, a violation of the interest of India, conflict with justice or morality, and the existence of patent illegality in the arbitral award. Additionally, the concept of the "fundamental policy of Indian law" would cover compliance with
- 38 -
statutes and judicial precedents, adopting a judicial approach, compliance with the principles of natural justice, and Wednesbury [Associated Provincial Picture Houses v. Wednesbury Corpn., [1948] 1 K.B. 223 (CA)] reasonableness. Furthermore, "patent illegality" itself has been held to mean contravention of the substantive law of India, contravention of the 1996 Act, and contravention of the terms of the contract."
17. A similar view, as stated above, has been taken by this Court in K. Sugumar v. Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd. , where it has been observed as follows:
"2. The contours of the power of the Court under Section 34 of the Act are too well established to require any reiteration. Even a bare reading of Section 34 of the Act indicates the highly constricted power of the civil court to interfere with an arbitral award. The reason for this is obvious. When parties have chosen to avail an alternate mechanism for dispute resolution, they must be left to reconcile themselves to the wisdom of the decision of the arbitrator and the role of the court should be restricted to the bare minimum. Interference will be justified only in cases of commission of misconduct by the arbitrator which can find manifestation in different forms including exercise of legal perversity by the arbitrator."
18. It has also been held time and again by this Court that if there are two plausible interpretations of the terms and conditions of the contract, then no fault can be found,
- 39 -
if the learned Arbitrator proceeds to accept one interpretation as against the other. In Dyna Technologies (P) Ltd. v. Crompton Greaves Ltd.9, the limitations on the Court while exercising powers under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act has been highlighted thus:
"24. There is no dispute that Section 34 of the Arbitration Act limits a challenge to an award only on the grounds provided therein or as interpreted by various Courts. We need to be cognizant of the fact that arbitral awards should not be interfered with in a casual and cavalier manner, unless the Court comes to a conclusion that the perversity of the award goes to the root of the matter without there being a possibility of alternative interpretation which may sustain the arbitral award. Section 34 is different in its approach and cannot be equated with a normal appellate jurisdiction. The mandate under Section 34 is to respect the finality of the arbitral award and the party autonomy to get their dispute adjudicated by an alternative forum as provided under the law. If the Courts were to interfere with the arbitral award in the usual course on factual aspects, then the commercial wisdom behind opting for alternate dispute resolution would stand frustrated."
19. In Parsa Kente Collieries Limited v. Rajasthan Rajya Vidyut Utpadan Nigam Limited10, adverting to the previous decisions of this Court in McDermott International Inc. v. Burn Standard Co.
Ltd. and Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Ltd. v. Dewan Chand Ram Saran12, wherein it has been observed that an
- 40 -
Arbitral Tribunal must decide in accordance with the terms of the contract, but if a term of the contract has been construed in a reasonable manner, then the award ought not to be set aside on this ground, it has been held thus:
"9.1 ...........It is further observed and held that construction of the terms of a contract is primarily for an Arbitrator to decide unless the Arbitrator construes the contract in such a way that it could be said to be something that no fair-minded or reasonable person could do. It is further observed by this Court in the aforesaid decision in paragraph 33 that when a court is applying the "public policy" test to an arbitration award, it does not act as a court of appeal and consequently errors of fact cannot be corrected. A possible view by the Arbitrator on facts has necessarily to pass muster as the Arbitrator is the ultimate master of the quantity and quality of evidence to be relied upon when he delivers his arbitral award. It is further observed that thus an award based on little evidence or on evidence which does not measure up in quality to a trained legal mind would not be held to be invalid on this score.
9.2 Similar is the view taken by this Court in NHAI v. ITD Cementation (India) Ltd., (2015) 14 SCC 21, para 25 and SAIL v. Gupta Brother Steel Tubes Ltd., (2009) 10 SCC 63, para 29."
20. In Dyna Technologies (P) Ltd. (supra), the view taken above has been reiterated in the following words:
- 41 -
"25. Moreover, umpteen number of judgments of this Court have categorically held that the courts should not interfere with an award merely because an alternative view on facts and interpretation of contract exists. The courts need to be cautious and should defer to the view taken by the Arbitral Tribunal even if the reasoning provided in the award is implied unless such award portrays perversity unpardonable under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act."
21. An identical line of reasoning has been adopted in South East Asia Marine Engg. & Constructions Ltd. [SEAMAC Limited] v. Oil India Ltd.13 and it has been held as follows:
"12. It is a settled position that a court can set aside the award only on the grounds as provided in the Arbitration Act as interpreted by the courts. Recently, this Court in Dyna Technologies (P) Ltd. v. Crompton Greaves Ltd. [Dyna Technologies (P) Ltd. v. Crompton Greaves Ltd., (2019) 20 SCC 1 : 2019 SCC OnLine SC 1656] laid down the scope of such interference. This Court observed as follows :
(SCC pp. 11-12, para 24) "24. There is no dispute that Section 34 of the Arbitration Act limits a challenge to an award only on the grounds provided therein or as interpreted by various Courts. We need to be cognizant of the fact that arbitral awards should not be interfered with in a casual and cavalier manner, unless the Court comes to a conclusion that the perversity of
- 42 -
the award goes to the root of the matter without there being a possibility of alternative interpretation which may sustain the arbitral award. Section 34 is different in its approach and cannot be equated with a normal appellate jurisdiction. The mandate under Section 34 is to respect the finality of the arbitral award and the party autonomy to get their dispute adjudicated by an alternative forum as provided under the law. If the Courts were to interfere with the arbitral award in the usual course on factual aspects, then the commercial wisdom behind opting for alternate dispute resolution would stand frustrated."
13. It is also settled law that where two views are possible, the Court cannot interfere in the plausible view taken by the arbitrator supported by reasoning. This Court in Dyna Technologies [Dyna Technologies (P) Ltd. v. Crompton Greaves Ltd., (2019) 20 SCC 1 : 2019 SCC OnLine SC 1656] observed as under
: (SCC p.12, para 25)
25. Moreover, umpteen number of judgments of this Court have categorically held that the Court should not interfere with an award merely because an alternative view on facts and interpretation of contract exists. The Courts need to be cautious and should defer to the view taken by the Arbitral Tribunal even if the reasoning provided in the award is implied unless such award portrays perversity unpardonable under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act."
- 43 -
22. In the instant case, we are of the view that the interpretation of the relevant clauses of the Implementation Agreement, as arrived at by the learned Sole Arbitrator, are both, possible and plausible. Merely because another view could have been taken, can hardly be a ground for the learned Single Judge to have interfered with the arbitral award. In the given facts and circumstances of the case, the Appellate Court has rightly held that the learned Single Judge exceeded his jurisdiction in interfering with the award by questioning the interpretation given to the relevant clauses of the Implementation Agreement, as the reasons given are backed by logic.
17. A perusal of the various contentions urged by the appellant before the commercial court as well as before this Court clearly indicate that the same are in the realm of appreciation of evidence which is clearly beyond the scope and ambit of the limited and restricted jurisdiction available under Sections 34 and 37 of the said Act of 1996. As stated supra, the grievance of the appellant who was the petitioner / applicant before the commercial court in Com.A.S.No.62/2019 is with regard to not allowing the entire claims -F, G and H and partly allowing claims - D, E and I put forth by the appellant who contends that the claims ought to have been allowed in favour of the
- 44 -
appellant and not only a part / portion of the claims as had been done by the Arbitral Tribunal; a perusal of the arbitral award will clearly indicate that the Arbitral Tribunal has carefully and properly considered and appreciated the pleadings and evidence of the parties in relation to all the claims and has come to the conclusion that though the appellant had sought several amounts in relation to the aforesaid claims - D to I, the appellant was entitled to only a part / portion of the claims and that the appellant had not adduced sufficient legal or acceptable evidence which would entitle him to the entire claim. Under these circumstances, having regard to the limited and restricted scope of interference with the arbitral award which was based on appreciation of evidence and not on account of any non-
consideration of evidence nor based on no evidence, the commercial court was fully justified in dismissing the petition / application filed by the appellant under Section 34 of the said Act of 1996.
18. It is equally well settled that the Court dealing with an application under Section 34 of the said Act of 1996 filed by the unsuccessful claimant cannot enhance or increase the amounts granted by the Arbitral Tribunal in
- 45 -
favour of the claimant nor can a claim be granted for the first time by the Section 34 Court by modifying, varying or correcting the arbitral award and the only option available to the Section 34 Court is to set aside the arbitral award, if permissible as stated supra and relegate the parties to fresh arbitration, if they so desire, as held by the Apex Court in the case of Mc. Dermott International INC Vs. Burn Standard Co. Ltd., & others reported in (2006) 11 SCC 181 and followed by Co-ordinate Bench of this Court in the case of Smt. Padma Mahadev and others Vs. M/s. Sierra Constructions passed in COMAP No.2/2021 dated 22.03.2021. In the instant case, the material on record discloses that while claims - A and B were fully allowed by the Arbitral Tribunal, claims - F, G and H were rejected and claims - C, D, E and I were allowed only in part, aggrieved by which the appellant filed the petition/application under Section 34 of the said Act of 1996. In view of the aforesaid well settled position of law stated supra that the Section 34 Court, muchless this Court in an appeal under Section 37 of the said Act of 1996 cannot pass an award granting a claim that was rejected in respect of claims - F , G and H nor grant the claim of the
- 46 -
appellant in full in relation to claims - C, D, E and I, we are of the considered opinion that the trial Court was fully justified in confirming the impugned Arbitral Award, which does not warrant interference on this ground also.
19. On careful perusal of the material on record and after giving our anxious consideration to the rival submissions, we are of the considered opinion that the Arbitral Tribunal has rightly held that the termination of the agreement was illegal because the respondent failed to prove the grounds of termination, the termination was arbitrary and against the principles of natural justice. The Arbitral Tribunal had jurisdiction to adjudicate the dispute as the agreements were statutory contracts executed under the provisions of Transparency in Public Procurements Act.
The award passed by the Tribunal is based on evidence and as such, no interference is required by the Court under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.
The Commercial Court has rightly rejected the cases filed under Section 34 of the said Act of 1996. The impugned award passed by the Tribunal as well as impugned judgment and order passed by the Commercial Court are correct and proper and they do not contain any illegality or
- 47 -
infirmity nor the same can be said to be perverse or capricious warranting interference by this Court in the present appeal under Section 37 of the said act of 1996.
20. Accordingly, we do not find any merit in the appeal and the same is hereby dismissed.
