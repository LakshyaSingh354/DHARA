CORAM:
HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE RAJIV SAHAI ENDLAW

1.      The plaintiff Super Cassettes Industries Pvt. Ltd. has filed these suits

to restrain the defendant in each of the suits from broadcasting or otherwise

communicating to the public cinematograph films, sound recordings, literary

works (lyrics) and musical works (musical composition) owned by the

plaintiff and in which the plaintiff claims a copyright and for ancillary

reliefs.

2.      Each of the suits is valued for the purposes of court fees and

jurisdiction at (i) Rs.200/- for the relief of permanent injunction; (ii) Rs.200/-

for the relief of rendition of accounts; (iii) Rs.200/- for the relief of

mandatory injunction; and, (iv) Rs.25,01,000/- for the relief of recovery of

damages i.e. for a total of Rs.25,01,000/- and on which court fees of

Rs.26,753/- has been paid.


CS(COMM) Nos.775, 777, 779, 783, 785, 787 & 789 of 2016               Page 3 of 21
 3.      It is further the case of the plaintiff that the dispute subject matter of

each of the suits is a commercial dispute within the meaning of Section

2(1)(c)(xvii) of the Commercial Courts, Commercial Division and

Commercial Appellate Division of High Courts Act, 2015 (Commercial

Courts Act) i.e. a dispute arising out of intellectual property rights relating to

registered or unregistered trademarks, copyrights, designs etc.

4.      Per Section 7 of the Commercial Courts Act, suits relating to

commercial dispute of a „specified value‟ only are to be tried and disposed of

by the Commercial Division of the High Court. „Specified Value‟, as per

clause (i) of Section 2(1) of the Commercial Courts Act has been defined as

the value of the subject matter in respect of a suit as determined in

accordance with Section 12 which shall not be less than Rs.1 crore. Per

Section 12(1)(d), where the relief claimed in a suit relates to any other

intangible right (other than recovery of money or other moveable property or

immovable property dealt with in Clauses (a), (b) and (c) of Section 12(1)),

the specified value of the suit shall be the market value of the said right as

estimated by the plaintiff.




CS(COMM) Nos.775, 777, 779, 783, 785, 787 & 789 of 2016               Page 4 of 21
 5.      The plaintiff has valued the intangible rights, as aforesaid at Rs.200/-

each and besides the reliefs with respect to such intangible rights has claimed

the relief of recovery of money, by way of damages, in the sum of

Rs.25,00,000/- and the specified value whereof as per Section 12(1)(a) of the

Commercial Courts Act is Rs.25,00,000/- only. Thus the aggregate specified

value of the reliefs claimed in the suit is Rs.25,01,600/- which is less than

Rs.1 crore prescribed in Section 2(1)(i) supra. It was thus enquired from the

counsel for the plaintiff when the suits came up first before this Court on 11th

July, 2016 as to how the suits were entertainable by the Commercial

Division of this Court and as to why the plaint be not returned to the plaintiff

for presentation before the Court of appropriate pecuniary jurisdiction. On

request of counsel for the plaintiff, the suits were adjourned to 19 th July,

2016 for hearing on this aspect.

6.      The plaintiff, though estimating the market value of the intangible

right to which each of the suit pertains at less than Rs.1 crore, contends this

Court has jurisdiction to entertain the suits owing to the first Proviso to

Section 7 of the Commercial Courts Act.




CS(COMM) Nos.775, 777, 779, 783, 785, 787 & 789 of 2016             Page 5 of 21
 7.      Section 7 of the Commercial Courts Act is as under:

        "7. Jurisdiction of Commercial Divisions of High Courts--
        All suits and applications relating to commercial disputes of a
        Specified Value filed in a High Court having ordinary original
        civil jurisdiction shall be heard and disposed of by the
        Commercial Division of that High Court:
               Provided that all suits and applications relating to
        commercial disputes, stipulated by an Act to lie in a court not
        inferior to a District Court, and filed or pending on the original
        side of the High Court, shall be heard and disposed of by the
        Commercial Division of the High Court:
               Provided further that all suits and applications
        transferred to the High Court by virtue of sub-section (4) of
        section 22 of the Designs Act, 2000 (16 of 2000) or section 104
        of the Patents Act, 1970 (39 of 1970) shall be heard and
        disposed of by the Commercial Division of the High Court in all
        the areas over which the High Court exercises ordinary
        original civil jurisdiction."
                                                          (emphasis added)


8.      It is the contention of the plaintiff (A) that by virtue of Section 62(1)

of the Copyright Act, 1957, all matters relating to a dispute under the

Copyright Act fall within the purview of the first Proviso aforesaid of

Section 7 i.e. stipulated by law to lie in a Court not inferior to a District

Court; (B) that the first Proviso to Section 7 supra uses the expression "filed

or pending" and which has to be necessarily interpreted as meaning "already

pending on the date of enactment of the Commercial Courts Act" or "filed

after the enactment of the Commercial Courts Act"; (C) that the word "filed"

CS(COMM) Nos.775, 777, 779, 783, 785, 787 & 789 of 2016               Page 6 of 21
 cannot be restricted to suits filed before the enactment of the Commercial

Courts Act.

9.      The counsel for the plaintiff on 19th July, 2016 argued that (I) if the

words of a statute are unambiguous, then literal interpretation has to be

adopted and applied; (II) the first proviso supra by using both, "filed" as well

as "pending" with the conjunction "or" as against "and" implies that it

applies to both, suits which were pending as on the date when the

Commercial Courts Act came into force as well as suits filed thereafter; (III)

if the first proviso to Section 7 supra is interpreted to apply only to suits filed

or pending prior to the date of commencement of the Commercial Courts

Act, it would amount to ascribing the words „filed‟ and „pending‟ the same

meaning, defeating the wording of the statute; (IV) that in the Commercial

Courts, Commercial Division and Commercial Appellate Division of High

Courts Bill, 2015 (and the Ordinance) which preceded the Commercial

Courts Act, the word "pending" was missing in the clause corresponding to

the first Proviso to Section 7 and was added only in the Act, and which is

also indicative of the intention of the Legislature to make the first Proviso to

Section 7 of the Act applicable also to suits filed after coming into force of

the Act; (V) that the Press Note released by the Press Information Bureau


CS(COMM) Nos.775, 777, 779, 783, 785, 787 & 789 of 2016                Page 7 of 21
 also provided that Section 7 was being amended, so as to clarify that the

Commercial Courts Act applies to pending matters also; (VI) that the statute

cannot be read as imposing a condition that the suits ought to have been filed

or pending as on the date of coming into force thereof--had it been so, the

wording of the first Proviso to Section 7 would have been "previously filed

or pending" or "filed or pending on the date when the Act comes into force".

10.     The counsel for the plaintiff, in support of his submissions, placed

reliance on (a) Guiness World Records Limited Vs. Sababbi Mangal 230

(2016) DLT 377; (b) Dental Council of India Vs. Hari Prakash (2001) 8

SCC 61 to contend that when the words used in the statute are not

ambiguous, literal meaning has to be applied; (c) C.L. Devgun Vs. New

Delhi Municipal Council 2008 (155) DLT 180 to contend that inclusion of

word that is not present in the statute, by the Court is impermissible; (d) The

Tata     Oil     Mills      Co.      Ltd.     Vs.     Hansa   Chemical   Pharmacy

MANU/DE/0153/1978 Delhi 236 to clarify that the expression "District

Court" in Section 62(1) of the Copyright Act included the local limits of the

ordinary original civil jurisdiction of a High Court; (e) Rahisuddin Vs.

Gambit Leasing & Finance Pvt. Ltd. 2011 (176) DLT 696 to again clarify

as to what the expression "District Court" means and to contend that the


CS(COMM) Nos.775, 777, 779, 783, 785, 787 & 789 of 2016                  Page 8 of 21
 same means the Court of the District Judge and not the court of the Civil

Judge.

11.     The counsel for the plaintiff, on 19th July, 2016, without prejudice to

his rights and contentions also stated that if this Court were not agreeable

with the contention of the plaintiff, instead of ordering the plaint to be

returned for filing in the Court of appropriate jurisdiction, the same be

transferred to the Court of the District Judge under Section 24(5) of Code of

Civil Procedure, 1908 (CPC), as the plaintiff is not desirous of paying

additional court fees, if found to be due. It was also informed that the

concerned District Court would be the District Court (Central), Tis Hazari

Courts, Delhi.

12.     I am unable to agree with the contentions aforesaid of counsel for the

plaintiff.

13.     The Commercial Courts Act came into force on 23rd October, 2015 i.e.

shortly before the Delhi High Court (Amendment) Act, 2015 which came

into force on 26th October, 2015 and vide which the ordinary original civil

jurisdiction of this Court was enhanced from that till then existing with

respect to suits valuation whereof was in excess of Rs.20 lakhs to that with

respect to suits valuation whereof is in excess of Rs.2 crores. Section 4 of

CS(COMM) Nos.775, 777, 779, 783, 785, 787 & 789 of 2016             Page 9 of 21
 the Delhi High Court (Amendment) Act empowers the Chief Justice of this

Court to transfer any suit or other proceeding which is pending in this Court

immediately before the commencement thereof to such Subordinate Court as

would have jurisdiction to entertain such suit or proceeding, had such suit or

proceeding been instituted or filed for the first time after the commencement

thereof. In accordance therewith, the suits instituted in this Court prior to 26th

October, 2015, even if be relating to commercial dispute within the meaning

of Commercial Courts Act, with a valuation of upto Rs.2 crores were liable

to be transferred to the Subordinate Courts. However, since as per the

Commercial Courts Act suits arising of commercial dispute and specified

value whereof is Rs.1 crore or more are to be tried and disposed of by

Commercial Division of this Court, only suits arising out of commercial

dispute and specified value whereof was less than Rs.1 crore were liable to

be so transferred to the Subordinate Courts.

14.     The question for consideration in Guiness World Records Limited

supra was, whether owing to the first proviso to Section 7 of the Commercial

Courts Act, the suits arising out of commercial dispute and stipulated by law

to be in a Court not inferior to a District Court and instituted in this Court

prior to the coming into force of the Delhi High Court (Amendment) Act and


CS(COMM) Nos.775, 777, 779, 783, 785, 787 & 789 of 2016               Page 10 of 21
 with a specified value of less than Rs.1 crore were also required to be tried

and disposed of by this Court rather than being transferred to the Subordinate

Court under Section 4 of the Delhi High Court (Amendment) Act. It was

observed, found, held (i) that in Section 7 of the Ordinance preceding the

Commercial Courts Act, only the word "filed" found mention; (ii) that Press

Note dated 16th December, 2015 was issued to clarify that amendment was

required to the first Proviso to Section 7 of the Ordinance so that no doubt

remained that the same was intended to apply to "pending cases only"; (iii)

that the reason given in the 78th Report submitted to the Rajya Sabha by the

Department-Related Parliamentary Standing Committee on Personnel, Public

Grievances, Law and Justice, for changing the word "filed" in the first

Proviso to Section 7 of the Ordinance to the expression "filed or pending" as

found in the Act was that transfer of all pending commercial disputes to

Commercial Division would over burden the said Division defeating the very

purpose of establishment thereof and the need for a sunset clause whereby

only fresh cases having the pecuniary limit were filed before the Commercial

Division (iv) that the words "filed or pending" mean that even if a case is

pending as on the date of coming into force of the Commercial Courts Act,

such pending case will be continued to be tried by the Commercial Division


CS(COMM) Nos.775, 777, 779, 783, 785, 787 & 789 of 2016            Page 11 of 21
 irrespective of the matter not being above the specified value and being

below the specified value of Rs.1 crore; (v) that there cannot be any other

interpretation of the expression "filed or pending"; (vi) that if these words

are to be interpreted to mean that even those cases which are filed and

pending will have to be transferred since their pecuniary value is less than

Rs.1 crore, it will defeat the intention of the Legislature in enacting the first

Proviso to Section 7; (vii) that the "IPR matters", once they are pending in

the High Court as on the date of coming into force of the Commercial Courts

Act, will be heard and disposed of by the Commercial Division of the High

Court, even if the pecuniary jurisdiction of these matters is below Rs.1 crore.

15.     It would thus be seen that though this Court in Guiness World

Records Limited supra was not concerned with the issue as has arisen herein

but interpreted the expression "filed or pending" in the first Proviso to

Section 7 of the Commercial Courts Act as meaning only those suits which

were pending on the date of coming into force of the Commercial Courts

Act.

16.     To the same effect is the view of two other learned Single Judges of

this Court in Kamal Sharma Vs. Blue Coast Infrastructure Development

Pvt. Ltd. 229 (2016) DLT 438 and in Sanofi Aventis Vs. Intas


CS(COMM) Nos.775, 777, 779, 783, 785, 787 & 789 of 2016              Page 12 of 21
 Pharmaceuticals Ltd. 227 (2016) DLT 296.

17.     The contention of the counsel for the plaintiff, that the word "filed"

has to be necessarily interpreted as filed after the coming into force of the

Commercial Courts Act as the suits filed before the coming into force of the

Commercial Courts Act would be covered by the word "pending", also does

not find favour with me. A suit filed before the coming into force of the

Commercial Courts Act may not necessarily be pending on the date of

coming into force thereof. Such a situation can also arise from dismissal in

default or dismissal for non-prosecution or dismissal on merits on a

preliminary issue, of a suit and in which case the suit, though would not

qualify as "pending" on the date of coming into force of the Commercial

Courts Act, would be capable of being revived by seeking restoration/ recall

of the order of dismissal in default or of dismissal for non-prosecution or by

preferring an appeal. Similarly, a suit by mere institution in the Court though

would qualify as „filed‟ may not, till it is admitted and summons thereof

issued, qualify as „pending‟ in the Court. The purport of the Legislature in

use of the words "filed or pending" in the first Proviso to Section 7 thus does

not necessarily have to be to include within the ambit thereof besides the

suits of the class mentioned therein and pending in this Court on the date of


CS(COMM) Nos.775, 777, 779, 783, 785, 787 & 789 of 2016            Page 13 of 21
 the coming into force of Commercial Courts Act also the suits of that class

„filed‟ in this Court after the coming into force of Commercial Courts Act,

even if of specified value of less than Rs.1 crore prescribed in Section 2(1)(i)

of the Act.

18.     The contention of the counsel for the plaintiff, ingenious though it is,

cannot be accepted also for the reason that such interpretation of the first

proviso to Section 7 supra would not be in consonance with the other

provisions of the Commercial Courts Act. According to the interpretation

canvassed by the counsel for the plaintiff, suits of the class mentioned in the

first proviso can be „filed‟ (after coming into force of Commercial Courts

Act) in a High Court having ordinary original civil jurisdiction, even if not of

the specified value. It would mean that for suits relating to commercial

disputes stipulated by law to lie in a Court not inferior to a District Court,

there is no specified value. However Section 2(1)(i), while defining specified

value as meaning value of subject matter in respect of a suit as defined in

accordance with Section 12 which shall not be less than Rs.1 crore, does not

exclude therefrom suits stipulated by law to lie in a Court not inferior to a

District Court. Similarly Section 12, while prescribing the mode of

determination of specified value also prescribes, as aforesaid, in Clause (d)


CS(COMM) Nos.775, 777, 779, 783, 785, 787 & 789 of 2016             Page 14 of 21
 of Sub Section (1) thereof the mode of determining of specified value of a

commercial dispute where the relief sought relates to intangible rights, as is

in the "IPR matters" and which as per Section 104 of Patents Act, 1970,

Section 134 of Trade Marks Act, 1999, proviso to Section 22(2) of the

Designs Act, 2000 and Section 62 supra of the Copyright Act are stipulated

to be in a Court not inferior to a District Court. If such suits were to be heard

and disposed of by the Commercial Division of the High Court having

original civil jurisdiction even if not of specified value, there was no need for

the legislature to in Section 12(1)(d) provide for mode of determination of

specified value thereof. Section 15 of the Commercial Courts Act providing

for transfer of suits relating to commercial dispute of specified value pending

in a High Court where a Commercial Division has been constituted to the

Commercial Division also does not carve out any exception qua suits

stipulated by law to lie in a Court not inferior to a District Court. It thus

follows, that to interpret the first proviso to Section 7 of Commercial Courts

Act as enabling suits relating to commercial dispute stipulated by an Act to

be in a Court not inferior to a District Court to be „filed‟ on the original side

of the High Court, even after the coming into force of the Commercial

Courts Act and even if of below the specified value, would be inconsistent


CS(COMM) Nos.775, 777, 779, 783, 785, 787 & 789 of 2016              Page 15 of 21
 with Section 2(1)(i), Section 12 and Section 15 of the said Act.

19.     It is a settled principle of interpretation of statutes that provisions of a

statute have to be interpreted so as to give effect to all and any one provision

ought not to be interpreted so as to render another nugatory or otiose.

20.     The interpretation canvassed by the counsel for the plaintiff would

also inundate and over burden the Commercial Division of a High Court

having original civil jurisdiction with suits in „IPR Matters‟, even if specified

value thereof is below that prescribed in Section 2(1)(i), defeating one of

avowed objects for establishment of Commercial Division of High Court, of

expeditious disposal of such suits.

21.     Before proceeding further, I may notice that this court in Guinness

World Records Ltd. supra held on an interpretation of the first proviso to

Section 7 that „IPR matters‟ filed or pending in this Court, even if their

valuation is less than Rs.1 crore, will be dealt and decided by Commercial

Division of this court if their pecuniary jurisdiction valuation is above Rs.20

lakhs. Unfortunately Section 15 which provides for transfer to Commercial

Division of High Court only of suits relating to commercial dispute of a

specified value pending in a High Court was not noticed. I am however in

this judgment not concerned with suits „pending‟ on the date of coming in to

CS(COMM) Nos.775, 777, 779, 783, 785, 787 & 789 of 2016                 Page 16 of 21
 force of the Commercial Court Act and need not probe this aspect further.

22.     It was perhaps taking cue from Guinness World Record Ltd supra that

the plaintiff, though contending that suits of the class mentioned in first

proviso to Section 7, irrespective of whether of specified value or not, can be

continued to be filed in the High Court, valued the same for court fee and

jurisdiction at above Rs.20 lakhs. I had during the hearing enquired from the

counsel for the plaintiff that if what he was canvassing was to be correct,

where was the need to value the suit at over Rs.20 lakhs in as much as as per

the said interpretation the suit of that class even if valued as less than Rs.20

lakhs can be filed in this Court. The counsel for the plaintiff did not offer any

answer.

23.     This Court in Guinness World Records Ltd supra qua the pending

suits observed that if valued above Rs.20 lakhs would be heard by

Commercial Division of this court because the ordinary original civil

jurisdiction of this Court till the coming into force of Commercial Courts Act

was with respect to suits valuation whereof was above Rs.20 lakhs.

However that stood enhanced to above Rs.2 crore upon coming into force of

Delhi High Court (Amendment) Act. Delhi High Court (Amendment) Act is

however prospective. With respect to pending suits, it, as aforesaid,


CS(COMM) Nos.775, 777, 779, 783, 785, 787 & 789 of 2016              Page 17 of 21
 empowered the Chief Justice vide Section 4 thereof. Thus, a suit relating to

commercial dispute instituted in this Court prior to coming into force of

Delhi High Court (Amendment) Act, even if of valuation less than above

Rs.2 crores was to be dealt with under Section 4 thereof. However suits filed

after coming into force thereof could be entertained / could lie before this

Court only if valuation thereof was in excess of Rs.2 crores.              The

Commercial Courts Act however vested jurisdiction with respect to suits

relating to commercial disputes of a specified value prescribed as Rs.1 crore

and above in the Commercial Division of this Court. Thus though the

original civil jurisdiction of this Court as per Section 5 of Delhi High Court

Act, 1966 is in respect of suits value of which exceeds Rs.2 crores but the

Commercial Division of this Court by virtue of Section 7 has jurisdiction to

hear and dispose of suits relating to commercial dispute of specified value

prescribed as Rs.1 crore and above. To hold that the Commercial Division

of this Court also has jurisdiction to hear and dispose of suits relating to

commercial disputes of below the specified value filed after coming into

force of Delhi High Court (Amendment) Act and Commercial Courts Act

would also be violative of Section 5 of the Delhi High Court Act. There is

absolutely no rationale for holding that such suits, if valued above Rs.20


CS(COMM) Nos.775, 777, 779, 783, 785, 787 & 789 of 2016            Page 18 of 21
 lakhs, can be entertained by the Commercial Division of this Court.

24.      To hold that suits relating to Commercial Dispute and falling in the

class specified in the first proviso to Section 7, of below the specified value

of Rs.1 crore and axiomatically with payment of court fee on a lesser value

than Rs.1 crore can be filed in the Commercial Division of the High Court

will also amount to prescribing a lower court fee for „IPR matters‟ than for

other commercial dispute.

25.      A Division Bench of this Court in Delhi High Court Bar Association

Vs. Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (2013) 203 DLT

129, dealing with the challenge to the constitutionality and validity of the

Court Fees (Delhi Amendment) Act, 2012 inter alia providing fixed fee for

suits,    relating to intellectual property as compared to much higher ad

valorem court fees for other suits held i) that no intelligible differentia is

discernible for the magnanimity/favoured treatment to „IPR matters‟; ii) IPR

matters are of high value, time consuming and owing to urgency of relief

therein hearing thereof gets precedence and parties thereto are generally

economic grants; iii) that the favoured treatment to such suits is arbitrary,

unreasonable and ultra vires Article 14 of Constitution of India. The Court

Fees (Delhi Amendment) Act 2012 was accordingly struck down.


CS(COMM) Nos.775, 777, 779, 783, 785, 787 & 789 of 2016            Page 19 of 21
 26.      The interpretation of the first proviso to Section 7 of the Commercial

Courts Act canvassed by the counsel for the plaintiff thus also renders the

same susceptible to be struck down.                  It is also a settled principle of

interpretation of statutes that an interpretation, which makes the statute or

any provision thereof susceptible to be struck down as arbitrary or ultra

vires, is to be avoided.

27.      The words "filed or pending" in the first Proviso to Section 7 of the

Commercial Courts Act cannot thus be read as permitting commercial

disputes of the class prescribed in the first Proviso to Section 7 of the Act to

be continued to be filed in this Court, even if the value thereof is less than

the specified value of Rs.1 crore and above.

28.      The suits, as filed, are below the minimum pecuniary jurisdiction of

this Court and below the specified value in accordance with the Commercial

Courts Act and are thus not to be entertained by this Court and lie, if at all,

before the Court of the District Judge.

29.      In accordance with the statement of the counsel for the plaintiff and as

recorded in the order dated 19th July, 2016, the suits are ordered to be

transferred to the Court of the District Judge (Central), Tis Hazari Courts,

Delhi.

 30.     The plaintiff to appear before the Additional District Judge / District

Judge (Central), Tis Hazari Courts, Delhi on 8th September, 2016.
