       "'The Bombay High Court\\'s jurisdiction in this case would be determined by the interplay of the contract\\'s arbitration clause, the parties\\' conduct, and the provisions of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (Act, 1996).\\n\\n**Legal Principles and Jurisdictional Considerations:**\\n\\n* **Seat of Arbitration:** The contract\\'s stipulation that arbitration be held in London is crucial. The \"seat\" of arbitration determines the applicable law and the courts with supervisory jurisdiction over the arbitration proceedings.  \\n* **Party Autonomy:** Parties are generally free to agree on the terms of their contract, including the place of arbitration. This principle of party autonomy is enshrined in the Act, 1996.\\n* **Section 9 of the Act, 1996:** This section allows parties to an arbitration agreement to apply to the court for interim measures before or during the arbitral proceedings. However, the court\\'s jurisdiction to grant interim relief is not unlimited and must be exercised within the framework of the Act, 1996 and the principles of international arbitration.\\n* **Jurisdictional Considerations:**\\n    * **Exclusive Jurisdiction:** The court at the \"seat\" of arbitration generally has exclusive jurisdiction over disputes arising from the arbitration proceedings. This principle is supported by numerous Supreme Court decisions, including *Bhartiya Aluminium Company Ltd. vs. Kaiser Aluminium Technical Services* (2012) 9 SCC 552 (BALCO) and *BGS SGS Soma JV versus NHPC Ltd* (2004) 4 SCC 234.\\n    * **Significant Contrary Indicia:** Courts have recognized that the venue of arbitration can be treated as the \"seat\" of arbitration if there are \"significant contrary indicia\" suggesting that the parties intended the venue to be the seat. This exception is narrowly construed.\\n    * **Waiver:** A party can relinquish a known right, such as the right to object to jurisdiction, through their conduct. However, waiver must be clear and unequivocal.\\n\\n**Analysis:**\\n\\nIn this case, the foreign company\\'s argument that the Bombay High Court lacks jurisdiction is based on the contract\\'s designation of London as the seat of arbitration. The Bombay High Court would need to consider the following:\\n\\n1. **Express Agreement:** The contract\\'s express agreement on London as the seat of arbitration is a strong indicator that the parties intended London to be the seat.\\n2. **Parties\\' Conduct:** The Bombay High Court would need to examine the parties\\' conduct to determine if there are any \"significant contrary indicia\" suggesting that the parties intended Bombay to be the seat. For example, if the joint venture company had consistently conducted its business operations in India and had not raised any objections to the Bombay High Court\\'s jurisdiction in the past, this could be considered a contrary indicia.\\n3. **Waiver:** The foreign company could argue that the joint venture company has waived its right to object to the Bombay High Court\\'s jurisdiction by filing the application for interim relief. However, the Bombay High Court would need to determine if the joint venture company\\'s actions constitute a clear and unequivocal waiver.\\n\\n**Conclusion:**\\n\\nBased on the legal principles and jurisdictional considerations discussed above, the Bombay High Court would likely find that it lacks jurisdiction to grant interim relief in this case. The contract\\'s express agreement on London as the seat of arbitration, coupled with the lack of significant contrary indicia, suggests that London is the appropriate forum for resolving the dispute. The joint venture company\\'s application for interim relief would likely be dismissed.\\n\\n**Case Names:**\\n\\n* Sikkim Power Development Corporation Ltd. & Anr. vs. Amalgamated Transpower (India) Ltd. & Amalgamated Transpower (India) Ltd. vs. M/s Sikkim Power Development Corporation Ltd. & Anr.\\n* M/S. D. M. Corporation Pvt. Ltd. vs. The State of Maharashtra\\n* Arss - Sips (Jv) A Joint Venture vs Union Of India\\n* M/S Zapdor-Ubc-Abnjv Delhi vs U.O.I.
