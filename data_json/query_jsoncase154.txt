    "Query": "A contractor, XYZ Construction, entered into a contract with the state government for the construction of a new bridge. The contract had a clause stipulating liquidated damages for delays. The contractor faced delays due to unforeseen circumstances like heavy rainfall and a change in design specifications requested by the government. XYZ Construction claims that the delay was not due to their fault and that the liquidated damages clause is unreasonable and should not be enforced. The state government insists on the liquidated damages clause and claims that the delays were due to the contractor's negligence. How does the court determine whether the liquidated damages clause is enforceable and if the delay was within the contractor's control?",
    "Legal Principles": "The court will analyze the liquidated damages clause to determine if it represents a genuine pre-estimate of damages or if it is a penalty clause. It will also consider the principles of 'frustration of contract' and 'force majeure' to assess if the delays were beyond the contractor's reasonable control.",
    "Relevant Sections": "Sections 73 and 74 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, will be relevant. The court will examine the clause to determine if the stipulated amount is a reasonable pre-estimate of damages. It will also consider if the delays were due to 'frustration of contract' or 'force majeure', which are situations beyond the control of the parties.",
    "Context": "This case involves a contractual dispute between a contractor and a state government, centering on the enforcement of a liquidated damages clause in a construction contract."
