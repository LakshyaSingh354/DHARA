    "Query": "A company based in India contracted with a foreign company for the supply and installation of equipment. The contract included a jurisdiction clause specifying that disputes would be resolved in a Singapore court. The Indian company later filed a suit in India seeking an injunction against the foreign company and a bank that issued a bank guarantee. The Indian court dismissed the suit, holding that it lacked territorial jurisdiction due to the jurisdiction clause. The Indian company appealed the decision. How does the principle of forum conveniens apply in cases with jurisdiction clauses, and can the Indian court still exercise jurisdiction if the foreign company is not a party to the proceedings in India?",
    "Legal Principles": "Forum conveniens, jurisdiction clauses, ouster clause, natural jurisdiction, inherent jurisdiction, anti-suit injunctions, Order VII Rule 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure (CPC), Section 20(3) of the CPC.",
    "Relevant Sections": "Order VII Rule 10 of the CPC, Section 20(3) of the CPC.",
    "Context": "This is an appeal from an order dismissing a suit for want of territorial jurisdiction, arising from a contract with a jurisdiction clause specifying a foreign court as the forum for dispute resolution.
