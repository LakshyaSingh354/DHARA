    "Query": "A landlord filed a suit for possession of a commercial property against a tenant. The tenant claims that the suit is not maintainable as the landlord failed to initiate pre-institution mediation as required by the Commercial Courts Act, 2015. The tenant also argues that the landlord incorrectly valued the relief of possession.  The court has passed a decree of possession in favor of the landlord. Can the tenant challenge this decree?",
    "Legal Principles": "The Commercial Courts Act, 2015 mandates pre-institution mediation in commercial disputes, but this requirement is not applicable where urgent interim relief is sought.  The valuation of a suit for possession is governed by Section 7(xi) of the Court Fees Act, 1870, which prescribes valuation based on the annual rent.  A challenge to the jurisdiction of a court must be raised promptly, and a decree of possession cannot be set aside based on a belated jurisdictional objection.",
    "Relevant Sections": "Section 12-A of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, Section 7(xi) of the Court Fees Act, 1870, Order VIII Rule 3A (5) of CPC as amended by the Act of 2015, Order XXXIX Rule 1 and 2 of CPC, Section 96 read with Order XLI of CPC",
    "Context": "This case concerns the application of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 in a landlord-tenant dispute, specifically relating to pre-institution mediation and valuation of the suit. The tenant is challenging the decree of possession issued by the Commercial Court."

    "Legal Principles": "The Commercial Courts Act, 2015 provides a specific appeal mechanism for decisions of Commercial Courts.

In India, the Code of Civil Procedure (CPC) governs appeals in civil matters.
