    "Query": "A company has been sued for non-payment of invoices for goods supplied. The company argues that it has a valid defence and should be granted unconditional leave to defend. The original plaintiff argues that the defendant has consumed the goods without dispute and should be required to deposit a sum of money as a condition to defending the suit. What are the legal principles governing the granting of leave to defend in a summary judgment proceeding?",
    "Legal Principles": "The legal principles governing the granting of leave to defend in a summary judgment proceeding are based on Order XXXVII of the Code of Civil Procedure (CPC). The principles are as follows:\n\n1. **If the defendant satisfies the Court that they have a substantial defence, that is, a defence that is likely to succeed, the original plaintiff is not entitled to leave to sign judgment, and the defendant is entitled to unconditional leave to defend the suit.**\n\n2. **If the defendant raises triable issues indicating that they have a fair or reasonable defence, although not a positively good defence, the original plaintiff is not entitled to sign judgment, and the defendant is ordinarily entitled to unconditional leave to defend.**\n\n3. **Even if the defendant raises triable issues, if a doubt is left with the trial judge about the defendant's good faith, or the genuineness of the triable issues, the trial judge may impose conditions both as to time or mode of trial, as well as payment into court or furnishing security. Care must be taken to see that the object of the provisions to assist expeditious disposal of commercial causes is not defeated. Care must also be taken to see that such triable issues are not shut out by unduly severe orders as to deposit or security.**\n\n4. **If the Defendant raises a defence which is plausible but improbable, the trial Judge may impose conditions as to time or mode of trial, as well as payment into court, or furnishing security. As such a defence does not raise triable issues, conditions as to deposit or security or both can extend to the entire principal sum together with such interest as the court feels the justice of the case requires.**\n\n5. **If the Defendant has no substantial defence and/or raises no genuine triable issues, and the court finds such defence to be frivolous or vexatious, then leave to defend the suit shall be refused, and the original plaintiff is entitled to judgment forthwith.**\n\n6. **If any part of the amount claimed by the original plaintiff is admitted by the defendant to be due from him, leave to defend the suit, (even if triable issues or a substantial defence is raised), shall not be granted unless the amount so admitted to be due is deposited by the defendant in court.**",
