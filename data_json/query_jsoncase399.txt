    "Query": "A plaintiff is seeking to strike out the defense of the defendant, Union of India, and have the suit treated as undefended because the defendant has failed to file a written statement for 16 years. The defendant claims that an arbitration proceeding is pending and the plaintiff's company does not exist in the record of the Registrar of Companies. What are the legal principles and relevant sections governing the filing of written statements in commercial suits under the Commercial Courts Act, 2015?",
    "Legal Principles": "The Commercial Courts Act, 2015, aims for speedy disposal of commercial disputes. It amends the Code of Civil Procedure (CPC) to establish a streamlined procedure for commercial suits.  Section 16 of the Act mandates that Commercial Divisions follow the amended CPC provisions, including the timeframes for filing written statements. Section 15(4) provides for new timelines in cases transferred to Commercial Divisions, superseding the original 120-day limit for filing written statements.",
    "Relevant Sections": "**Section 16(2)** of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015:  'The Commercial Division and Commercial Court shall follow the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908), as amended by this Act, in the trial of a suit in respect of a commercial dispute of a Specified Value.'\n\n**Section 15(4)** of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015: 'The Commercial Division or Commercial Court, as the case may be, may hold case management hearings in respect of such transferred suit or application in order to prescribe new timelines or issue such further directions as may be necessary for a speedy and efficacious disposal of such suit or application in accordance 3 [with Order XV-A] of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908): Provided that the proviso to sub-rule (1) of Rule 1 of Order V of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908) shall not apply to such transferred suit or application and the court may, in its discretion, prescribe a new time period within which the written statement shall be filed.'",
    "Context": "Commercial Division of Calcutta High Court. This is a case concerning a suit seeking to strike out the defense of the Union of India, and treat it as undefended, given the defendant's delay in filing a written statement."

    "Query": "A plaintiff has filed a suit seeking a declaration that the defendant's action of terminating a contract was wrongful.  The defendant, a public sector company, is arguing that the plaintiff's company is defunct and does not exist, rendering the suit non-maintainable.  Is a suit maintainable even if the plaintiff company is dissolved after the cause of action arises?",
    "Legal Principles": "The legal principle of *actio personalis moritur cum persona* ("a personal action dies with the person") generally does not apply to corporations. Even though a corporation may be dissolved or defunct, if a cause of action arose before dissolution, the suit can be maintained. The legal representatives or successor-in-interest can continue the legal proceedings.",
    "Relevant Sections": "None specifically mentioned in the provided judgment. However, this issue relates to the legal principles of corporate dissolution and its impact on pending lawsuits.",
    "Context": "Commercial Division of Calcutta High Court. This is a case where the defendant is raising the defense of non-maintainability of the suit due to the plaintiff company's defunct status."

    "Query": "A plaintiff is seeking a mandatory injunction compelling the defendant, a private construction company, to perform a contract. The defendant argues that the contract has been validly terminated and is therefore not obliged to perform. However, the plaintiff alleges that the termination was wrongful and that the defendant breached the terms of the contract. Does the pendency of an arbitration proceeding regarding the contract termination affect the court's jurisdiction to issue an injunction?",
    "Legal Principles": "The pendency of arbitration proceedings does not automatically oust the court's jurisdiction to issue an injunction. The court may exercise its jurisdiction to grant an injunction if it finds that the injunction is necessary to protect the plaintiff's rights and prevent irreparable harm. The court will consider the nature of the dispute, the balance of convenience, and the likelihood of success on the merits.",
    "Relevant Sections": "None specifically mentioned in the provided judgment. However, the legal principles regarding injunctions are relevant here, particularly the court's discretion to issue injunctions despite the existence of an arbitration clause.",
    "Context": "Commercial Division of Calcutta High Court. This is a case where the plaintiff seeks a mandatory injunction for performance of a contract, despite the defendant arguing for contract termination and the existence of an arbitration proceeding."

    "Query": "The defendant, a government department, is challenging the authority of the current counsel representing the plaintiff in a suit concerning a public tender process. What legal principles and provisions govern the appointment and authority of counsel in legal proceedings?",
    "Legal Principles": "In Indian legal proceedings, any individual can appear as a counsel if they have a valid vakalatnama (power of attorney) authorizing them to act on behalf of the client. The authority of counsel is derived from the vakalatnama, which is a formal document signed by the client.  The court may inquire into the validity of the vakalatnama if there is a challenge to the counsel's authority.",
    "Relevant Sections": "Section 30 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908: This section deals with the power of attorney for representing parties in a suit.  A person can appear in court and act for a party if they have a valid vakalatnama. ",

What are the legal principles and provisions governing the applicability of the Limitation Act in contract disputes?",
    "Legal Principles": "The Limitation Act, 1963, prescribes specific timeframes within which a suit must be filed.

The court will consider the specific facts and circumstances of the case to determine whether the limitation period should be extended.",
    "Relevant Sections": "Section 3 of the Limitation Act, 1963: This section provides general rules for computation of the limitation period.  Section 5 of the Limitation Act, 1963: This section deals with the extension of the limitation period in certain cases.",

Can a government agency be held liable for breach of contract, or is it protected by sovereign immunity?",
    "Legal Principles": "The doctrine of sovereign immunity generally protects governments from lawsuits without their consent. However, the government can be held liable for breach of contract if it enters into a contract in its commercial or trading capacity, as opposed to its sovereign capacity. The court will examine the nature of the contract and the government's role in the transaction to determine whether sovereign immunity applies.",
    "Relevant Sections": "None specifically mentioned in the provided judgment. However, the legal principles related to sovereign immunity and its exceptions are relevant here."

The defendant is arguing that the plaintiff's claim is barred by the doctrine of *caveat emptor* ("let the buyer beware"). What are the legal principles and provisions governing the doctrine of *caveat emptor* in contract law?",
    "Legal Principles": "The doctrine of *caveat emptor* generally places the burden on the buyer to inspect the goods or services before purchasing them. However, the doctrine does not apply if the seller makes a misrepresentation that induces the buyer to enter the contract. The court will examine the nature of the misrepresentation and its impact on the buyer's decision to determine whether the doctrine of *caveat emptor* applies.",
    "Relevant Sections": "None specifically mentioned in the provided judgment. However, the legal principles related to the doctrine of *caveat emptor* and its exceptions are relevant here."

The court will examine the nature of the threat and the circumstances surrounding the contract to determine whether duress existed.",
    "Relevant Sections": "Section 15 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872: This section deals with contracts entered into under coercion, which is similar to duress.  It states that a contract is voidable if it is entered into under coercion.",
    "Context": "Commercial Division of Calcutta High Court. This is a case where the defendant is raising the defense of duress to avoid the enforcement of a contract."

What are the legal principles and provisions governing the doctrine of *volenti non fit injuria* in negligence law?",
    "Legal Principles": "The doctrine of *volenti non fit injuria* applies when a plaintiff voluntarily assumes the risk of injury.
