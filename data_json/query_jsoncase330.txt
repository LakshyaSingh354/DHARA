    "Query": "A buyer filed an application seeking reframing of issues and additional evidence in an arbitration under the MSMED Act. The Council rejected the application, and the buyer appealed to the Commercial Court under section 37 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act. The Commercial Court dismissed the appeal. The buyer now seeks to challenge the Commercial Court's order through a Civil Revision Petition, arguing that the Court lacked inherent jurisdiction. What are the limits of the High Court's power under Article 227 of the Constitution in this context?",
    "Legal Principles": "The High Court's power under Article 227 of the Constitution is limited to cases of serious dereliction of duty and violation of fundamental principles of law and justice. The Court should be circumspect in interfering with jurisdictional Courts and Tribunals, especially when the revision petitioner's conduct indicates irresponsible behaviour. The principle of 'no man can take advantage of his own wrong' applies when a party manipulates the Court process to perpetuate an illegality.",
    "Relevant Sections": "Article 227 of the Constitution of India, Section 37 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, Section 17(1) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, Section 18(1) and 18(3) of the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Development Act, 2006, Section 3 of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, Section 6 of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, Section 19 of the MSMED Act",
