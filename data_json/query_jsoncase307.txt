    "Query": "A company, 'Tech Solutions Inc.', entered into an agreement with a software developer, 'Code Wizards LLC', for the development of a custom software application. After the project was completed, Tech Solutions Inc. refused to pay the full amount due to alleged defects in the software. Code Wizards LLC filed a claim for arbitration, and the arbitrator awarded them the full contract price. Tech Solutions Inc. now seeks to challenge the arbitration award in court, arguing that the arbitrator exceeded his authority by failing to consider certain evidence. How does the court determine whether the arbitrator exceeded his authority in this case?",
    "Legal Principles": "The court will apply the principle of judicial review of arbitration awards, which is limited to determining whether the arbitrator exceeded his authority or acted in a manner that violated due process. This involves examining the scope of the arbitration agreement and the arbitrator's interpretation of the contract.",
    "Relevant Sections": "Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (A&C Act) deals with the grounds for setting aside an arbitral award. The relevant section is:\n\n\"34. Setting aside arbitral award.-(1) An arbitral award may be set aside by the Court on any of the following grounds, namely:- (a) that the arbitral award is in conflict with the public policy of India; (b) that the arbitral tribunal was improperly constituted or that the arbitral proceedings were conducted in a manner which is contrary to the provisions of this Part; (c) that the arbitral award deals with a dispute not contemplated by or not falling within the terms of the submission to arbitration, or that the arbitral award contains decisions on matters beyond the scope of the submission to arbitration; (d) that the arbitral award has been obtained by fraud or corruption; or (e) that a party was unable to present its case at the arbitration proceedings because of the arbitral tribunal's failure to act fairly and impartially.\n\n(2) Where an application is made under sub-section (1), the Court may, if satisfied that the grounds specified in that sub-section are proved, set aside the arbitral award and remit the matter to the arbitral tribunal for reconsideration, or make such other order as it deems fit.\n\n(3) An application under this section shall be made within three months from the date on which the party making the application received the arbitral award or, if a request for the correction or interpretation of the award has been made under section 33, within three months from the date on which the party making the application received the decision on the request."
    "Context": "This is a case in India involving a challenge to an arbitration award based on the grounds of the arbitrator exceeding his authority. The case falls under the jurisdiction of the Indian courts and is governed by the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996."

Prime Properties sued BuildRight Construction for breach of contract in the civil court. BuildRight Construction argued that the dispute should be referred to arbitration. Can Prime Properties prevent the dispute from being referred to arbitration in this case?",
    "Legal Principles": "The principle of 'kompetenz-kompetenz' allows an arbitral tribunal to decide its own jurisdiction. However, there are limitations on this principle, and a court can interfere if there is a clear case of 'non-arbitrability.'",
