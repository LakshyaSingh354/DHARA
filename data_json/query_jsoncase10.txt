    "Query": "A plaintiff in a commercial suit filed in Delhi seeks to rely on additional documents that were not produced along with the plaint. The plaintiff claims the documents were not available at the time of filing the suit.  The defendant argues that the plaintiff's reason for not disclosing the documents is an afterthought and that the plaintiff should have produced the documents in a timely manner. Can the plaintiff rely on these additional documents?",
    "Legal Principles": "Order XI Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure (CPC) as applicable to commercial suits mandates the plaintiff to disclose all documents in their power, possession, control, or custody pertaining to the suit. However, Order XI Rule 1(4) allows plaintiffs to seek leave to rely on additional documents within 30 days of filing the suit, provided they establish reasonable cause for not disclosing the documents with the plaint.  The court may grant leave even if the documents were not in the plaintiff's possession at the time of filing the suit if the plaintiff establishes they were discovered subsequently. The court's discretion to grant leave is informed by the circumstances of the case, including the urgency of the filing, the timeliness of the application, and the plaintiff's explanation for the non-disclosure.

    "Query": "A plaintiff in a commercial suit before the Commercial Court in Delhi seeks to produce invoices as additional documents. The plaintiff argues that the invoices were not in their possession at the time of filing the plaint.  The defendant objects to the production of the invoices and argues that the plaintiff should have disclosed them earlier. The Commercial Court dismisses the plaintiff's application to produce the invoices. Does the High Court have the power to overturn the Commercial Court's order?",
    "Legal Principles": "Order XI Rule 1 of the CPC, as applicable to commercial suits, mandates the plaintiff to disclose all documents in their power, possession, control, or custody pertaining to the suit.  The Commercial Court has discretion to permit the production of additional documents under Order XI Rule 1(4) if the plaintiff establishes a reasonable cause for not disclosing them with the plaint. The High Court may overturn the Commercial Court's decision if it finds the Commercial Court erred in exercising its discretion, such as by applying an incorrect legal standard or failing to consider relevant factors.",

    "Query": "A plaintiff in a commercial suit seeks to rely on a large volume of documents that were not produced with the plaint. The plaintiff claims the documents were not filed due to their voluminous nature.  The defendant objects to the production of the documents and argues that the plaintiff should have disclosed them earlier.  Should the court grant leave for the plaintiff to rely on the documents?",
    "Legal Principles": "Order XI Rule 1 of the CPC, as applicable to commercial suits, requires the plaintiff to disclose all documents in their power, possession, control, or custody pertaining to the suit.  While Order XI Rule 1(4) allows the plaintiff to seek leave to rely on additional documents, the plaintiff must establish reasonable cause for not disclosing the documents with the plaint. The court considers the urgency of the filing, the timeliness of the application, and the plaintiff's explanation for the non-disclosure when determining if reasonable cause exists.  The court may not find that the voluminous nature of the documents constitutes a sufficient reason for non-disclosure if the plaintiff had ample time to produce the documents before filing the suit.",
