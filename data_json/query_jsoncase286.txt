    "Query": "A defendant in a commercial suit filed a written statement beyond the 120-day limit prescribed by Order VIII Rule 11 of the CPC, citing the Supreme Court's extension of limitation periods due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Commercial Court dismissed the defendant's application to take the written statement on record. Can the defendant appeal the order, and what legal principles should be considered?",
    "Legal Principles": "The Supreme Court's decision in Prakash Corporates v. Dee Vee Projects Ltd. established that the orders issued in Re: Cognizance for Extension of Limitation extended the terminus ad quem for filing pleadings and proceedings, including written statements. This effectively enlarges the time for filing, making it irrelevant if the filing occurred within the extended period, regardless of the normal limitation period. The High Court in HT Media Ltd v. Brainlink International, Inc., while dismissed by the Supreme Court on appeal, considered the defendant's conduct in determining whether to grant the benefit of the Supreme Court's extension orders.",
    "Relevant Sections": "Order VIII Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (CPC), as amended by the Commercial Courts Act, 2015. \n\nOrder VIII Rule 1 of the CPC. \n\nArticle 227 of the Constitution of India. \n\nArticle 141 and 144 of the Constitution of India.",
    "Context": "This case involves a defendant appealing a Commercial Court's order refusing to accept a written statement filed beyond the prescribed time limit, citing the Supreme Court's extension of limitation periods during the COVID-19 pandemic.

    "Query": "A plaintiff filed a suit for breach of contract against a company.

The plaintiff argued that the delay was due to unforeseen circumstances related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The trial court dismissed the plaintiff's argument and held that the suit was barred by limitation. Can the plaintiff appeal this decision? What legal arguments can they raise?",
    "Legal Principles": "The Limitation Act, 1963 governs the period within which legal proceedings must be initiated. The Supreme Court in Prakash Corporates v. Dee Vee Projects Ltd. held that the COVID-19 pandemic-related orders extending limitation periods apply to all proceedings, including those related to contract law. The plaintiff can argue that the period from 15.03.2020 to 28.02.2022, as per the Supreme Court's orders, should be excluded in calculating the limitation period.",
    "Relevant Sections": "Section 5 of the Limitation Act, 1963 (extension of prescribed period). \n\nSections 12 to 15 of the Limitation Act, 1963 (exclusion of time). \n\nArticle 142 of the Constitution of India (plenary powers of the Supreme Court).",
