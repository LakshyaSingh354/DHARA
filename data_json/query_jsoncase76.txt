    "Query": "A company filed an application to set aside an arbitral award under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. The court stayed the enforcement of the award, but the company wants to appeal this decision. Is the appeal maintainable under Section 13 of the Commercial Courts, Commercial Division and Commercial Appellate Division of High Courts Act, 2015?",
    "Legal Principles": "The Commercial Courts Act, 2015, provides for a specialized mechanism to handle commercial disputes. The Act's Section 13 specifies the appeal process, while the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, outlines the procedures for setting aside and enforcing arbitral awards. The Supreme Court has emphasized that when a special law, like the Arbitration Act, establishes a self-contained code, the general law procedures are impliedly excluded. This principle was applied in the case of Kandla Export Corporation v/s. M/s. OCI Corporation.",

One company filed a suit in the Commercial Court, seeking a declaration of its rights under the agreement. The other company contested the jurisdiction of the Commercial Court, arguing that the dispute should be resolved through arbitration. The Commercial Court refused to refer the matter to arbitration. Can the company that sought arbitration appeal this decision?",
    "Legal Principles": "The Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, provides for a mechanism to refer disputes to arbitration. Section 8 of the Act deals with the power of the court to refer matters to arbitration.  An order refusing to refer parties to arbitration is appealable under Section 37 of the Act. The Commercial Courts Act, 2015, has jurisdiction over commercial disputes, including those involving arbitration, and can decide whether a dispute should be referred to arbitration.",

    "Query": "A company filed an application to set aside an arbitral award, but the court dismissed the application. The company wants to appeal the decision, but the court says that the appeal is not maintainable. Is the court's decision correct?",
    "Legal Principles": "Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, deals with applications to set aside arbitral awards.  Section 37 of the Act explicitly mentions that an appeal lies from an order setting aside or refusing to set aside an arbitral award under Section 34. Appeals from orders under Section 34 are therefore maintainable, as specified in Section 37.",

    "Query": "A company won an arbitration award but the other party filed an application to set aside the award under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. The court granted a stay on the enforcement of the award pending the outcome of the application to set aside. Can the company appeal the court's decision to stay the enforcement of the award?",
    "Legal Principles": "The Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, allows for the stay of an arbitral award pending the outcome of an application to set aside the award. However, this judgment specifically addresses the appealability of stay orders issued in the context of arbitral awards. According to the judgment, such stay orders are not appealable, as they are not enumerated among the appealable orders in Section 37 of the Act. Appeals against such orders are thus barred, even if they could be considered akin to injunction orders under the Code of Civil Procedure.",

This judgment, however, clarifies that stay orders in the context of arbitral awards are not appealable.

    "Legal Principles": "Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, provides grounds for setting aside arbitral awards, including when the award is based on a fundamental error of law.
