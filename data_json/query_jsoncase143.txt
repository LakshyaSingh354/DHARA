    "Query": "A Plaintiff filed a suit in the Bombay High Court's Commercial Division seeking a declaration that the Defendant's actions constituted a breach of contract. The Defendant failed to file a written statement within the stipulated 120 days from the date of service of the summons. The Defendant sought condonation of delay, arguing that they were experiencing unforeseen circumstances. Can the Court condone the delay and allow the Defendant to file a written statement after 120 days?",
    "Legal Principles": "The Commercial Courts Act, 2015 mandates a 120-day deadline for filing a written statement in Commercial Suits. This deadline is mandatory and cannot be extended beyond 120 days, even in cases of unforeseen circumstances.",
    "Relevant Sections": "Order VIII Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, as amended by the Commercial Courts Act, 2015:  \"Provided that where the defendant fails to file the written statement within the said period of thirty days, he shall be allowed to file the written statement on such other day, as may be specified by the Court, for reasons to be recorded in writing and on payment of such costs as the Court deems fit, but which shall not be later than one hundred twenty days from the date of service of summons and on expiry of one hundred twenty days from the date of service of summons, the defendant shall forfeit the right to file the written statement and the Court shall not allow the written statement to be taken on record.\"",
    "Context": "This case involves a commercial dispute in the Bombay High Court's Commercial Division. The issue is whether the Court can condone a delay in filing a written statement beyond the statutory 120-day limit under the Commercial Courts Act, 2015."

    "Query": "A Plaintiff filed a suit in the Bombay High Court's Commercial Division for recovery of a debt. The Defendant argued that the suit was barred by limitation. The Plaintiff claimed that the period of limitation was suspended due to certain circumstances. The Defendant argued that the Plaintiff had failed to properly plead the suspension of the period of limitation. Can the Court allow the Plaintiff to amend the plaint to include the necessary pleading regarding the suspension of limitation?",
    "Legal Principles": "The principle of 'res judicata' prohibits the relitigation of matters that have already been decided by a competent court. The doctrine of 'waiver' may arise when a party knowingly and voluntarily relinquishes a known right. The court may allow amendment of pleadings if it is satisfied that it is necessary for the ends of justice.",
    "Relevant Sections": "Order VI Rule 17 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908: \"The court may at any stage of the proceedings, allow either party to alter or amend his pleading in such manner and on such terms as may be just, and all such amendments shall be made as may be necessary for the purpose of determining the real questions in controversy between the parties.\"",
    "Context": "This case involves a commercial dispute in the Bombay High Court's Commercial Division. The issue is whether the Court can allow an amendment to the plaint to address the Defendant's objection regarding the suspension of the period of limitation."

    "Query": "A Plaintiff filed a suit in the Bombay High Court's Commercial Division for specific performance of a contract. The Defendant argued that the contract was unenforceable due to a lack of consideration. The Plaintiff argued that the Defendant was estopped from raising the defense of lack of consideration. Can the Court apply the doctrine of estoppel to bar the Defendant from raising the defense?",
    "Legal Principles": "The doctrine of 'estoppel' prevents a party from asserting a claim or defense that is inconsistent with a previous position taken by that party. The elements of estoppel include representation, reliance, and detriment.",
    "Relevant Sections": "Section 115 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872: \"When one person has, by his declaration, act, or omission, intentionally caused or permitted another person to believe a thing to be true, and to act upon such belief, the former is not permitted to deny the truth of that thing.",
    "Context": "This case involves a commercial dispute in the Bombay High Court's Commercial Division. The issue is whether the doctrine of estoppel can be applied to prevent the Defendant from raising a defense of lack of consideration."

    "Query": "A Plaintiff filed a suit in the Bombay High Court's Commercial Division for damages arising from a breach of contract. The Defendant argued that the Plaintiff had failed to mitigate its losses. Can the Court consider the principle of mitigation of damages in determining the Plaintiff's entitlement to damages?",
    "Legal Principles": "The principle of 'mitigation of damages' requires a Plaintiff to take reasonable steps to minimize their losses after a breach of contract. Failure to mitigate damages may result in a reduction of the damages awarded.",
    "Relevant Sections": "Section 73 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872: \"When a contract has been broken, the party who is not in default is entitled to receive from the party in default, compensation for any loss or damage caused to him thereby, which naturally arose in the usual course of things from such breach, or which the parties knew, when they made the contract, to be likely to result from the breach of it, but which compensation is not to be given for any remote and indirect loss or damage sustained by reason of the breach.",

    "Query": "A Plaintiff filed a suit in the Bombay High Court's Commercial Division for a declaration that a certain agreement was void. The Defendant argued that the Plaintiff had waived its right to challenge the agreement. Can the Court determine whether the Plaintiff's actions constituted a waiver of its right to challenge the agreement?",
    "Legal Principles": "The doctrine of 'waiver' arises when a party intentionally relinquishes a known right. Waiver must be clear and unequivocal, and the party waiving the right must have full knowledge of its existence.",
    "Relevant Sections": "Section 6 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872: \"Agreements, the parties to which are incompetent to contract, are void.\"",
    "Context": "This case involves a commercial dispute in the Bombay High Court's Commercial Division. The issue is whether the Plaintiff's actions constitute a waiver of its right to challenge the validity of an agreement."

    "Query": "A Plaintiff filed a suit in the Bombay High Court's Commercial Division for a mandatory injunction compelling the Defendant to perform certain actions. The Defendant argued that the Plaintiff had an adequate remedy at law. Can the Court issue a mandatory injunction if the Plaintiff has an adequate remedy at law?",
    "Legal Principles": "A mandatory injunction is a court order compelling a party to perform a specific act. Injunctions are typically granted when there is no adequate remedy at law.",
    "Relevant Sections": "Section 38 of the Specific Relief Act, 1877: \"Where the court is satisfied that on the balance of convenience the plaintiff is entitled to an injunction, it may grant an injunction either perpetual or temporary, to prevent the breach of any contract, or the commission of any wrongful act, or the continuance of any wrongful act, which would be a breach of any contract,
