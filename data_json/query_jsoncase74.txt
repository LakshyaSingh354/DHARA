    "Query": "A contractor, ABC Construction, is seeking to enforce an interim award granted by an arbitral tribunal against DEF Corporation, the project owner. However, DEF Corporation has filed an application under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, seeking to set aside the interim award, arguing that it was incorrectly granted. ABC Construction maintains that the Section 34 application is premature because an application for correction of the award under Section 33 is pending before the arbitral tribunal. Can the Commercial Court entertain the Section 34 application while the Section 33 application is pending?",
    "Legal Principles": "The court must consider the scheme of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, particularly Sections 33 and 34, and their interplay. The principle of 'unbreakability' of time limits for challenging awards, as established in P. Radha Bai & Ors. v. P. Ashok Kumar & Anr., is relevant. The court must also consider the impact of parallel proceedings on the efficiency and finality of arbitration.",
    "Relevant Sections": "Section 33: Correction or Interpretation of Arbitral Award. Section 34: Setting Aside Arbitral Award. Section 34(3): Limitation period for challenging awards. Section 5: Judicial intervention in arbitration proceedings.",
    "Context": "This query involves the interplay of Sections 33 and 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, in the context of a challenge to an interim arbitral award. It concerns the application of the 'unbreakability' principle of time limits and the potential for parallel proceedings to disrupt arbitration."

    "Query": "A construction company, XYZ Builders, has been awarded a contract by the State Government for a road construction project. Disputes arose during the project execution, and XYZ Builders filed an application for an interim award under Section 31(6) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. The arbitral tribunal granted the interim award. However, the State Government is challenging the award through a Section 34 application before the Commercial Court. XYZ Builders argues that the Commercial Court lacks jurisdiction to entertain the Section 34 application while the Section 33 application for correction of the award is pending before the arbitral tribunal. Can the High Court, under Article 227, interfere in the Commercial Court's proceedings?",
    "Legal Principles": "The High Court's supervisory jurisdiction under Article 227 should be exercised sparingly and only in cases where there is a patent lack of jurisdiction or a clear error that would result in a miscarriage of justice. The court must balance the principle of judicial restraint with the need to ensure fair and efficient resolution of disputes. The Arbitration Act is a self-contained code, and judicial intervention should be minimal.",
    "Relevant Sections": "Article 227: Supervisory jurisdiction of High Courts. Section 33: Correction or Interpretation of Arbitral Award. Section 34: Setting Aside Arbitral Award. Section 5: Judicial intervention in arbitration proceedings.",
    "Context": "This query concerns the High Court's exercise of supervisory jurisdiction under Article 227 in a case involving the challenge to an interim award under the Arbitration Act. It involves the delicate balancing of the court's power to intervene with the need to avoid unnecessary delays in arbitration proceedings."
