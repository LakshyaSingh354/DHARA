    "Query": "A contract dispute between a software development company (Plaintiff) and a client (Defendant) arose. The Defendant claims the software delivered does not meet the agreed specifications, and they are refusing to pay the final installment. The Plaintiff argues the software functions as intended and has provided evidence of testing and project milestones. The Defendant has filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that the Plaintiff is not entitled to payment. What are the key legal principles and precedents that the court should consider when deciding this motion for summary judgment?",
    "Legal Principles": "The court should consider the elements of breach of contract, including: 1) the existence of a valid contract; 2) the Defendant's breach of the contract; 3) the Plaintiff's damages as a result of the breach.

The moving party (Defendant) has the initial burden of demonstrating that there is no genuine issue of material fact. If the moving party meets this burden, the non-moving party (Plaintiff) must then present evidence to show that there is a genuine issue of material fact for trial.",

The court should consider the evidence presented by both parties and determine whether there is a genuine issue of material fact that must be decided by a jury.
