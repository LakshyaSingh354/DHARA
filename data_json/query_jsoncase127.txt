    "Query": "A company, 'Tech Solutions LLP', was granted an interim injunction by an Arbitral Tribunal against 'DataCorp Inc.' preventing them from selling or transferring certain intellectual property rights. DataCorp Inc. filed an appeal against this order, arguing that the appeal should be heard by the District Court, not the High Court. What is the legal basis for determining the appropriate court for such an appeal, and does the High Court have jurisdiction in this case?",
    "Legal Principles": "The jurisdiction of courts in appeals against interlocutory orders made by an Arbitral Tribunal is determined by Section 37 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, which specifies the 'court' as the Principal Civil Court of original jurisdiction in a district.  The High Court generally does not possess original jurisdiction in such matters. The Act defines 'court' under Section 2(1)(e) to include the High Court only when exercising its ordinary original civil jurisdiction or in the case of international commercial arbitration. The High Court's power to hear such appeals depends on the type of arbitration involved and whether it has original jurisdiction over the subject matter.",
