    "Query": "A commercial lease agreement was executed in Mumbai, with an arbitration clause specifying that the venue of arbitration is Delhi. The parties later engaged in arbitration proceedings in Mumbai, with both parties submitting to the jurisdiction of the Mumbai court. However, the respondent now argues that the seat of arbitration is in Delhi and seeks to have the proceedings transferred.  What is the relevant legal framework for determining the seat of arbitration when the parties have engaged in contradictory conduct, and does the respondent's conduct constitute an estoppel?",
    "Legal Principles": "The determination of the seat of arbitration hinges on the intention of the parties, which can be gleaned from the arbitration clause, the parties' conduct, and any other relevant indicia. The Shashoua principle suggests that a venue, particularly when coupled with a supranational body of rules and no contrary indicia, can be construed as the seat of arbitration. However, the Supreme Court in Mankastu Impex Private Limited vs. Airvisual Limited clarified that the conduct of the parties can also be a significant factor in determining the seat. Estoppel applies when a party, through their conduct, leads another party to believe something, and that party then acts in reliance on that belief to their detriment. ",
    "Relevant Sections": "Section 20 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (Act) defines 'place of arbitration' and acknowledges party autonomy in choosing the venue. Section 42 of the Act lays down the principle of 'jurisdiction', stating that once an application under Part-I of the Act has been made in a court, that court shall have jurisdiction over the arbitration proceedings and subsequent applications. Section 2(1)(e) defines 'court' for the purposes of Part-I of the Act.",
    "Context": "This is a case involving domestic arbitration in India, where the parties have engaged in contradictory conduct regarding the seat of arbitration. The question at hand is whether the respondent's conduct estops them from arguing that the seat of arbitration is in Delhi, despite their previous actions that implied the seat was in Mumbai."

    "Query": "A construction contract was signed in Kolkata, with the arbitration clause stipulating the venue as New Delhi.  The parties engaged in arbitration proceedings in Kolkata, with both parties making submissions and the Arbitral Tribunal issuing an interim award. Now, one party seeks to challenge the interim award in New Delhi, arguing that New Delhi is the seat of arbitration.  Does the fact that the parties engaged in arbitration proceedings in Kolkata, including the issuance of an interim award, affect the determination of the seat of arbitration?",
    "Legal Principles": "The seat of arbitration is determined by the parties' intention, as evidenced by the arbitration clause, their conduct, and any other relevant indicia. While the venue may be a strong indicator of the seat, it is not determinative. The parties' conduct, including their active participation in arbitration proceedings in a particular location, can be considered a 'contrary indicia' that contradicts the venue designation. ",
    "Relevant Sections": "Section 20 of the Act defines 'place of arbitration' and acknowledges party autonomy in choosing the venue.

Section 2(1)(e) defines 'court' for the purposes of Part-I of the Act.",
    "Context": "This case involves domestic arbitration in India, where the parties have engaged in arbitration proceedings in a location different from the venue stipulated in the arbitration clause. The question is whether the parties' conduct, including the issuance of an interim award, constitutes a 'contrary indicia' that contradicts the venue designation and implies a different seat of arbitration."

    "Query": "A joint venture agreement was entered into in Bangalore, with the arbitration clause specifying Singapore as the venue of arbitration.  However, the parties had a previous dispute resolved through arbitration in Bangalore, with the Bangalore court exercising supervisory jurisdiction. Now, a new dispute arises, and one party seeks to initiate arbitration proceedings in Singapore, arguing that Singapore is the seat of arbitration. Does the fact that a previous dispute was resolved through arbitration in Bangalore, with the Bangalore court exercising supervisory jurisdiction, have any bearing on the determination of the seat of arbitration in the current dispute?",
    "Legal Principles": "The seat of arbitration is determined by the parties' intention, as evidenced by the arbitration clause, their conduct, and any other relevant indicia. The principle of 'jurisdiction' under Section 42 of the Act states that once an application under Part-I of the Act has been made in a court, that court shall have jurisdiction over the arbitration proceedings and subsequent applications. However, this principle is not absolute and can be affected by factors such as the parties' conduct and the existence of 'contrary indicia' that suggest a different seat of arbitration.",

Section 42 of the Act lays down the principle of 'jurisdiction', stating that once an application under Part-I of the Act has been made in a court, that court shall have jurisdiction over the arbitration proceedings and subsequent applications.

    "Context": "This case involves domestic arbitration in India, with a potential dispute arising in the context of a previous arbitration that was conducted in a different location.

    "Query": "A partnership agreement was entered into in Hyderabad, with the arbitration clause specifying that the venue of arbitration shall be New Delhi. The partners subsequently engaged in arbitration proceedings in Hyderabad, including the appointment of an arbitrator by the Hyderabad High Court under Section 11 of the Act.  However, one partner now seeks to have the arbitration proceedings transferred to New Delhi, arguing that New Delhi is the seat of arbitration. Does the fact that the Hyderabad High Court appointed the arbitrator under Section 11 of the Act create a binding precedent that establishes Hyderabad as the seat of arbitration?",
    "Legal Principles": "The appointment of an arbitrator by a High Court under Section 11 of the Act does not automatically determine the seat of arbitration. The seat is determined by the parties' intention, as evidenced by the arbitration clause, their conduct, and any other relevant indicia. The High Court's action in appointing the arbitrator under Section 11 is a procedural step and does not necessarily establish jurisdiction for subsequent proceedings, particularly when the arbitration clause specifies a different venue.",
    "Relevant Sections": "Section 11 of the Act deals with the appointment of arbitrators, where the Chief Justice of the High Court, or their delegate, may make the appointment. Section 20 of the Act defines 'place of arbitration' and acknowledges party autonomy in choosing the venue. Section 42 of the Act lays down the principle of 'jurisdiction', stating that once an application under Part-I of the Act has been made in a court, that court shall have jurisdiction over the arbitration proceedings and subsequent applications. Section 2(1)(e) defines 'court' for the purposes of Part-I of the Act.",
