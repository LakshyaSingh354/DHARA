    "Query": "A company is suing a former distributor for unpaid invoices. The distributor argues that they are not liable for the full amount due to a prior agreement and disputes certain invoice items. The company argues that the distributor's defenses are not valid and seeks summary judgment. Can the distributor be granted unconditional leave to defend, thus preventing summary judgment?",
    "Legal Principles": "Summary judgment is a procedural device that allows a court to dispose of a case without a full trial when there is no genuine dispute of material fact. A defendant may be granted leave to defend, preventing summary judgment, if they can demonstrate a genuine triable issue. However, the defendant must raise a genuine issue of material fact, not merely a 'bare denial' or 'mere assertion.' The court must consider the defendant's evidence and arguments in light of the plaintiff's claim.",
