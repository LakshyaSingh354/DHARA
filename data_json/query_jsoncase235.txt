    "Query": "A construction company has filed an arbitration claim against a government agency for delayed payments on a public project. The agency is challenging the award in court and has filed an application under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act to set aside the award. Should the court grant a stay on the execution of the award pending the outcome of the challenge under Section 34, and if so, what conditions should be imposed on the government agency?",
    "Legal Principles": "The court's power to grant a stay on the execution of an arbitral award under Section 36 of the Arbitration Act is subject to the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure (CPC).  In the case of a money decree, the court should ordinarily require the party seeking the stay to deposit the entire awarded amount, including interest and costs, as a condition for the stay. This principle applies equally to government agencies, despite the potential exemption from security requirements under Order 27 Rule 8A of the CPC.  The court must consider the principles of fairness and expeditious resolution of disputes when determining the conditions for a stay, ensuring that the decree holder is not unfairly deprived of the fruits of the award.",
