    "Query": "A company (Plaintiff) filed a suit against another company (Defendant) for breach of contract. The Defendant argued that the suit was filed in violation of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, as the Plaintiff failed to undergo pre-institution mediation. The Plaintiff, however, contends that the mandatory pre-institution mediation requirement was not applicable at the time of filing the suit because the mechanism for pre-institution mediation was not yet in place.  Should the suit be dismissed for non-compliance with the Commercial Courts Act?",
    "Legal Principles": "The applicability of the mandatory pre-institution mediation requirement under Section 12-A of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, depends on the stage of the litigation. It applies at the time of 'institution' of the suit, meaning when the suit is filed or presented in the Court. If, at the time of institution, a mechanism for pre-institution mediation is not in place, the requirement is not applicable.",
