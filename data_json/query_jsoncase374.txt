However, the defendant argued that the suit should be transferred to the Commercial Court based on the Commercial Courts, Commercial Division and Commercial Appellate Division of High Courts Act, 2015.  The Commercial Court has not yet been constituted in the district.  Should the suit be transferred to the Commercial Court or proceed in the regular Civil Court?",
    "Legal Principles": "The Commercial Courts, Commercial Division and Commercial Appellate Division of High Courts Act, 2015 (Commercial Courts Act) aims to expedite the resolution of commercial disputes by establishing specialized Commercial Courts and Divisions. The Act prescribes specific thresholds for the value of commercial disputes that necessitate their adjudication in these specialized forums. The jurisdiction of these specialized forums is contingent upon their establishment by the State government. Until the establishment of a Commercial Court, the regular Civil Court retains jurisdiction to handle commercial disputes.",
