    "Query": "A tenant is occupying a commercial property, and the landlord wants to evict them due to non-payment of rent. The tenant claims that the landlord failed to follow the mandatory pre-litigation mediation process required under the Commercial Courts Act, 2015. The landlord argues that the suit was filed before the mandatory mediation requirement came into effect. Should the suit be dismissed for failure to comply with the pre-litigation mediation process?",
    "Legal Principles": "Section 12-A of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 mandates pre-institution mediation in commercial disputes unless urgent relief is sought. This provision came into effect on 03-05-2018. The Supreme Court in Patil Automation Pvt. Ltd. v. Rakheja Engineers Pvt. Ltd. (2022 SCC Online SC 1028) declared Section 12-A mandatory and effective from 20-08-2022. The application of Section 12-A depends on when the suit was instituted, not when it was transferred to a Commercial Court.",

    "Query": "A landlord filed a suit for eviction of a tenant from a commercial property. The tenant filed an application to transfer the suit to a designated Commercial Court under Section 15 of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015. The Trial Court allowed the application and transferred the suit to the Commercial Court.  The landlord now claims that the dispute is not a commercial dispute within the meaning of the Act and the transfer was incorrect. Can the landlord challenge the Trial Court's order?",
    "Legal Principles": "Section 2(1)(c)(vii) of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 defines 'commercial dispute' to include disputes arising out of agreements relating to immovable properties used exclusively in trade or commerce. Section 15 of the Act allows for the transfer of suits to designated Commercial Courts if they involve a commercial dispute.
