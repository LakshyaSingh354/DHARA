    "Query": "A contractor, XYZ Construction, was awarded a contract to build a new school building for the state government. The contract stipulated a completion date, but XYZ Construction fell behind schedule due to unforeseen circumstances. The state government terminated the contract and blacklisted XYZ Construction. XYZ Construction filed for arbitration, and the arbitrator awarded them partial compensation. The state government challenged the arbitral award in court. The court, after considering the case, remanded it back to the arbitrator for further consideration of specific issues. XYZ Construction is now appealing this court decision, arguing that the court had no authority to remand the case back to the arbitrator. How does the law treat the power of a court to remand an arbitration matter back to the arbitrator after setting aside an award?",
