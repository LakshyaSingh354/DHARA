    "Query": "A company is seeking to terminate the mandate of an arbitrator due to undue delay in completing the arbitration proceedings. The company argues that the arbitrator has failed to act within the time limit prescribed by the court, even though the company itself has contributed to the delay by filing various motions and appeals. Can the mandate of the arbitrator be terminated under these circumstances?",
    "Legal Principles": "Section 14 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 deals with the termination of the mandate of an arbitrator due to failure or impossibility to act. Undue delay, as defined by the court, is a key factor in determining whether to terminate the mandate. The concept of waiver by conduct, where parties may be deemed to have waived their right to object to delays, is also relevant.",
