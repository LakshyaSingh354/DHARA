    "Query": "A company (Company A) entered into a lease and license agreement with another company (Company B) for the operation of a manufacturing unit. Later, Company B took a loan from a bank (Bank C) and Company A agreed to create a first charge on its assets to secure the loan. Company B subsequently defaulted on the loan and Company A wants to recover possession of the manufacturing unit. Company B claims that the dispute is not arbitrable as it involves multiple transactions and parties, including the bank, who are not parties to the arbitration agreement. How does the court determine the arbitrability of the dispute?",
    "Legal Principles": "The court will apply the principles of Section 8 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, as amended in 2015, to determine the arbitrability of the dispute. The key principles include: \n\n1. **Existence of a valid arbitration agreement:** The court must first determine whether a valid arbitration agreement exists between the parties to the dispute. If there is no valid arbitration agreement, the dispute cannot be referred to arbitration. \n\n2. **Scope of the arbitration agreement:** The court must then determine whether the dispute falls within the scope of the arbitration agreement. If the dispute is not covered by the agreement, it cannot be referred to arbitration. \n\n3. **Severability and competence-competence:** The court may refer the matter to arbitration even if there are some non-arbitrable issues, as long as the arbitrable issues can be separated from the non-arbitrable issues. The arbitral tribunal will then decide on the non-arbitrable issues. \n\n4. **Deadwood:** The court may not refer a matter to arbitration if it is “deadwood,” meaning that the dispute is entirely non-arbitrable and there is no reasonable prospect of the arbitral tribunal resolving the matter. \n\n5. **When in doubt, do refer:** The court should refer a matter to arbitration if there is any doubt about the validity of the arbitration agreement or the arbitrability of the dispute. This is to ensure that the parties have the opportunity to have the dispute resolved through arbitration. \n\n6. **Alter ego principle:** The court may bind a non-signatory party to an arbitration agreement if that party is the “alter ego” of a signatory party, meaning that they are essentially the same entity. \n\n7. **Direct benefits estoppel:** The court may prevent a non-signatory party from benefiting from a contract while simultaneously refusing to be bound by the arbitration clause in that contract. \n\n8. **Intertwined estoppel:** The court may bind a non-signatory party to arbitration if the dispute between the signatory and the non-signatory is “intertwined” with the agreement containing the arbitration clause. \n\nThe court will also consider the decisions of the Supreme Court of India in cases such as *Sukanya Holdings Pvt. Ltd. v. Jayesh H. Pandya & Anr.* (2003) 5 SCC 531, *Ameet Lalchand Shah and Ors. v. Rishabh Enterprises and Anr.* (2018) 15 SCC 678, *Vidya Drolia and Ors. v. Durga Trading Corporation* (2021) 2 SCC 1, *ONGC Ltd. v. Discovery Enterprises* (2022) 8 SCC 42, and *Intercontinental Hotels v. Waterline Hotels* (2022) 7 SCC 662.",
    "Relevant Sections": "Section 8 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, as amended by Act 3 of 2016 (w.r.e.f. 23.10.2015)",
    "Context": "This is a hypothetical case involving a commercial dispute between two companies, one of which is a licensee of the other. The dispute involves multiple transactions and parties, including a bank that provided a loan to the licensee. The court must decide whether the dispute is arbitrable under the terms of the arbitration agreement in the original lease and license agreement."

    "Query": "Two parties, A and B, entered into a contract for the sale of a piece of land. The contract included an arbitration clause. Party A later sold the land to a third party, C, without informing Party B. Party B now seeks to enforce the contract with Party A and is seeking a declaration that the sale to Party C is void. Party A claims that the dispute is not arbitrable because it involves a third party who is not a party to the arbitration agreement. Is the dispute arbitrable?",
    "Legal Principles": "The arbitrability of the dispute will depend on whether the dispute falls within the scope of the arbitration agreement and whether the third party (Party C) can be compelled to participate in the arbitration. The court will apply the principles of *Sukanya Holdings Pvt. Ltd. v. Jayesh H. Pandya & Anr.* (2003) 5 SCC 531, which states that the entire subject-matter of the suit must be subject to the arbitration agreement, and that bifurcation of the subject-matter of the suit is not allowed. The court will also consider the principles of *Vidya Drolia and Ors. v. Durga Trading Corporation* (2021) 2 SCC 1, which emphasizes that the arbitral tribunal is the preferred forum for determining non-arbitrability, and that the court should refer a matter to arbitration unless it is a clear case of deadwood. The court may also consider the principle of *intertwined estoppel*, which allows for the binding of a non-signatory party to arbitration if the dispute between the signatory and the non-signatory is intertwined with the agreement containing the arbitration clause.",

    "Query": "A construction company (Company A) entered into a contract with a homeowner (Homeowner B) to build a house. The contract contained an arbitration clause. During construction, a dispute arose regarding the quality of the work.
