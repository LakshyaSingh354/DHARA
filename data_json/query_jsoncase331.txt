    "Query": "A plaintiff filed a suit in the ordinary civil court for recovery of money due to him. The defendant argued that the dispute is commercial in nature and should be filed in the Commercial Court. The court, in its order, returned the plaint to be filed before the Commercial Court. The plaintiff seeks to challenge the order, arguing that the court should have transferred the case to the Commercial Court instead of returning the plaint. What are the legal principles applicable in such a situation?",
    "Legal Principles": "The court has the power to transfer a suit to a court of competent jurisdiction under Section 24 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. This power can be exercised even if the suit is filed in the wrong court. The court should consider the interests of justice when deciding whether to transfer a suit.",

    "Query": "A plaintiff filed a suit for recovery of money against a defendant, which was dismissed by the trial court due to a procedural defect. The plaintiff filed a review application, which was also dismissed by the trial court. The plaintiff now seeks to challenge both the original order dismissing the suit and the order dismissing the review application. Is the plaintiff's appeal maintainable?",
    "Legal Principles": "Orders passed under Order VII Rule 10 CPC are appealable. The plaintiff can appeal the dismissal of the suit and the dismissal of the review application.",

    "Query": "A plaintiff filed a suit for recovery of money against a defendant. The defendant argued that the suit was time-barred. The trial court, without giving the plaintiff an opportunity to address the issue, held that the suit was time-barred and returned the plaint. The plaintiff seeks to challenge this order. Was the trial court correct in returning the plaint without giving the plaintiff an opportunity to be heard?",
    "Legal Principles": "The principle of natural justice requires that a party be given an opportunity to be heard before an adverse order is passed against them. The trial court erred in returning the plaint without giving the plaintiff an opportunity to be heard.",

    "Query": "A plaintiff filed a suit in a civil court, which was subsequently held to be a commercial dispute. The court returned the plaint to be filed in the Commercial Court. The plaintiff filed the suit again in the Commercial Court, but within the limitation period, argued that the time between the return of the plaint and the refiling should be excluded. What are the legal principles and relevant sections applicable in this situation?",
    "Legal Principles": "The plaintiff can seek to exclude the time spent in pursuing the suit in the wrong court under Section 14 of the Limitation Act, 1963. The court may exclude this time if the plaintiff acted bona fide and diligently in pursuing the suit in the wrong court.",

Can the plaintiff argue that the time between the return of the plaint and the refiling should be excluded under Section 14 of the Limitation Act?",
