    "Query": "A defendant in a commercial dispute filed a written statement beyond the 120-day statutory period. The Commercial Court dismissed the application for condonation of delay. The defendant argues that the court had the power to grant an extension and that the statutory period should be counted from the date of transfer to the Commercial Court. Can the Commercial Court extend the time for filing a written statement beyond 120 days in a case transferred from a regular civil court?",
    "Legal Principles": "The Commercial Courts Act, 2015, amended the Code of Civil Procedure (CPC) to expedite commercial disputes. The Act established a mandatory time limit of 120 days for filing written statements in commercial disputes. However, cases transferred from regular civil courts are subject to specific provisions that allow the Commercial Court to prescribe a new time period for filing written statements.",
    "Relevant Sections": "Section 15(2), 15(4), 16 of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015; Order VIII Rule 1, 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure",

    "Query": "A company filed a suit for recovery of money against a partnership firm. The firm failed to file a written statement within the stipulated time. The firm later filed an application for extension of time, but it was dismissed due to the expiration of the 120-day time limit. Can the Commercial Court extend the time for filing a written statement beyond 120 days?",
    "Legal Principles": "The Commercial Courts Act, 2015 introduced a mandatory 120-day time limit for filing written statements in commercial disputes. This time limit is generally not extendable. However, exceptions exist for cases transferred from regular civil courts.",

    "Query": "A plaintiff filed a suit against a defendant for breach of contract. The defendant failed to file a written statement within the 120-day time limit. The defendant claims that the statutory period should be counted from the date of service of the summons and not the date of transfer to the Commercial Court. Is this argument valid?",
    "Legal Principles": "The statutory 120-day time limit for filing written statements in commercial disputes starts from the date of service of the summons. The transfer of a case from a regular civil court to a Commercial Court does not change this principle.  ",
