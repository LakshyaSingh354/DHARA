    "Query": "A company filed an appeal against an arbitral award challenging the award within 3 months of receiving it but was unable to file the appeal within the 30-day extension period after the initial 3 months due to an oversight. The company argues that they had sufficient cause for the delay, as they were diligently pursuing the appeal process. Can the court condone the delay, or is the 30-day extension period absolute?",
    "Legal Principles": "Section 34(3) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, sets out a specific time limit for challenging arbitral awards. The court may condone a delay of up to 30 days beyond the initial 3-month period if sufficient cause is shown. However, the phrase 'but not thereafter' in the proviso to Section 34(3) indicates that the court cannot condone any further delay beyond the 30-day extension.",
    "Relevant Sections": "**Section 34(3) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996:**\n\"An application for setting aside may not be made after three months have elapsed from the date on which the party making that application had received the arbitral award or, if a request had been made under section 33, from the date on which that request had been disposed of by the arbitral tribunal:\nProvided that if the Court is satisfied that the applicant was prevented by sufficient cause from making the application within the said period of three months it may entertain the application with a further period of thirty days, but not thereafter.\"",
    "Context": "Jurisdiction: India. Case type: Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. This query explores the application of the 'sufficient cause' provision in Section 34(3) and the interpretation of the phrase 'but not thereafter'."

    "Query": "A construction company filed an appeal against an arbitral award within the 3-month time limit but missed the 30-day extension period due to a misunderstanding about the specific date for filing the appeal. The company claims that this oversight was a genuine mistake and that they were diligently preparing their appeal. Can the court condone the delay based on the company's good faith and diligence?",
    "Legal Principles": "Section 34(3) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, states that the court may condone delay if the applicant was prevented by 'sufficient cause.' The court will consider the applicant's diligence, good faith, and the reasons for the delay. However, the 30-day extension is a statutory limit, and the court cannot condone delay beyond this period.",
    "Relevant Sections": "**Section 34(3) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996:**\n\"An application for setting aside may not be made after three months have elapsed from the date on which the party making that application had received the arbitral award or, if a request had been made under section 33, from the date on which that request had been disposed of by the arbitral tribunal:\nProvided that if the Court is satisfied that the applicant was prevented by sufficient cause from making the application within the said period of three months it may entertain the application with a further period of thirty days, but not thereafter.\"",

    "Query": "A company filed an appeal against an arbitral award within the 3-month time limit but did not file the appeal within the 30-day extension period due to a severe illness affecting the company's key personnel. The company provides medical documentation supporting their claim. Should the court condone the delay in this case?",
    "Legal Principles": "Section 34(3) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, allows for condonation of delay if the applicant was prevented by 'sufficient cause.' This encompasses situations where the applicant's ability to act was hindered by unforeseen circumstances, such as serious illness, that were outside their control. However, the court's discretion to condone delay is limited to the 30-day extension period.",

Due to this delay, the company missed the 3-month time limit for challenging the award. Can the company seek condonation of delay citing the delayed receipt of the award as sufficient cause?",
    "Legal Principles": "Section 34(3) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, calculates the time limit for challenging an award from the date the party receives the award. However, a delay in receiving the full copy of the award might constitute sufficient cause for condoning the delay, depending on the circumstances and the reason for the delay.
