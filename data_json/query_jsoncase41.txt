    "Query": "A construction company, 'ABC Construction', entered into a contract with a government agency, 'Odisha Housing Board', for the construction of a residential complex. Disputes arose regarding the payment terms and quality of work. The parties agreed to arbitration, and the Arbitrator issued an award in favor of ABC Construction. Odisha Housing Board filed an application under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (A&C Act) before the District & Sessions Judge (D&SJ), Cuttack, challenging the arbitral award. However, the D&SJ transferred the case to the Commercial Court established under the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 (CC Act). ABC Construction has approached the High Court challenging the transfer order, arguing that the D&SJ, being the 'Principal Civil Court' under the A&C Act, has exclusive jurisdiction over arbitration matters.",
    "Legal Principles": "The case revolves around the interplay between the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (A&C Act) and the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 (CC Act), specifically the question of jurisdiction over arbitration matters. Key legal principles involved include: \n\n* **Special vs. General Statutes:** The A&C Act being a special statute dealing with arbitration, its provisions may override the general provisions of the CC Act. \n\n* **'Generalia Specialibus non-derogant':**  General laws yield to specific laws.  \n\n* **'Principal Civil Court':** The A&C Act defines 'Court' as the Principal Civil Court of original jurisdiction in a district, which in Odisha is the D&SJ.  \n\n* **Jurisdictional Conflict:** The court must resolve the conflict between the A&C Act's definition of 'Court' and the CC Act's provision for jurisdiction over commercial disputes, including arbitration matters, being vested in the Commercial Court. \n\n* **Harmonious Construction:**  The court will attempt to interpret the two statutes in a way that avoids conflict and gives effect to the intent of both.  \n\n* **Retrospective Effect of Procedural Changes:**  Changes in procedural law, like the transfer of jurisdiction, can apply to existing cases.",
    "Relevant Sections": "**Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996:** \n\n* Section 2(1)(e): Defines 'Court' as the principal Civil Court of original jurisdiction in a district. \n\n* Section 34: Provides the remedy of challenging an arbitral award.  \n\n* Section 42:  States that once an application under the A&C Act is made in a Court, that Court alone has jurisdiction over the arbitral proceedings. \n\n**Commercial Courts Act, 2015:** \n\n* Section 3(3):  Allows the State Government, with the concurrence of the Chief Justice, to appoint judges to Commercial Courts.  \n\n* Section 10(3):  Specifies that arbitration matters 'other than international commercial arbitrations' fall under the jurisdiction of the Commercial Court. \n\n* Section 15(2):  Requires the transfer of all suits and applications, including those under the A&C Act, relating to commercial disputes to the Commercial Court.",
    "Context": "This case involves a dispute in Odisha between a construction company and a government agency. The dispute is regarding a construction contract and is subject to arbitration.  The High Court must decide whether the D&SJ or the Commercial Court has jurisdiction over the case, considering the provisions of the A&C Act and the CC Act."

    "Query": "A small business owner, 'Sri Ram Stores', filed a suit against a supplier, 'M/s.  Khandelwal Traders', for breach of contract, seeking a refund of payment for defective goods. The value of the claim is Rs. 4 lakhs. The case was filed in the Court of the Civil Judge (Senior Division), Cuttack. However, the State Government, after consulting with the High Court, notified the establishment of a Commercial Court in Cuttack with jurisdiction over commercial disputes of a value of Rs. 3 lakhs or more. The D&SJ subsequently transferred the case to the Commercial Court. Sri Ram Stores challenges the transfer order arguing that the Civil Judge (Senior Division) is the appropriate forum as the value of the claim falls below the threshold set for the Commercial Court.",
    "Legal Principles": "The case involves the application of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 (CC Act), specifically the issue of jurisdiction based on the pecuniary value of the claim. Key legal principles involved include: \n\n* **Pecuniary Jurisdiction:** The CC Act specifies a minimum value for commercial disputes to fall under the jurisdiction of the Commercial Court. \n\n* **Jurisdictional Threshold:** The court must determine whether the value of the claim in this case meets the threshold set for the Commercial Court in Cuttack. \n\n* **Transfer of Cases:**  The CC Act allows for the transfer of cases to the Commercial Court when the value of the claim and other conditions are met.  \n\n* **Harmonious Construction:**  The court will attempt to interpret the CC Act in a way that avoids conflict and gives effect to the intent of the legislature.

Sharma & Sons challenge the transfer order arguing that since the dispute involves a foreign company, it falls under the category of 'international commercial arbitration' and should be exclusively dealt with by the High Court.",
    "Legal Principles": "The case deals with the application of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 (CC Act) to international commercial arbitration. Key legal principles involved include: \n\n* **International Commercial Arbitration:** The A&C Act distinguishes between domestic and international commercial arbitrations. \n\n* **Jurisdiction over International Arbitration:**  The CC Act grants jurisdiction over international commercial arbitration applications or appeals arising out of such arbitration to the Commercial Division of the High Court.  \n\n* **Transfer of Cases:** The CC Act allows for the transfer of cases to the Commercial Court when the value of the claim and other conditions are met.  \n\n* **Harmonious Construction:**  The court will attempt to interpret the CC Act in a way that avoids conflict and gives effect to the intent of the legislature.
