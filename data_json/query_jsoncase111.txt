    "Query": "A plaintiff filed a commercial suit in a civil court instead of a commercial court. The defendant argued that the suit should be returned to the plaintiff to be filed in the appropriate commercial court. What are the legal principles and relevant sections that govern this situation?",
    "Legal Principles": "Order VII Rule 10 of the CPC governs the return of plaints to be presented to the court where they should have been instituted. The Supreme Court's decision in Ambalal Sarabhai Enterprises Ltd. v. K.S. Infraspace LLP & Anr. clarifies that a non-commercial suit filed in a commercial court must be returned to the plaintiff to be filed in a civil court. This principle, according to the Delhi High Court in Virender Kumar v. Rekha Bhayana, applies equally to commercial suits filed in civil courts.",
    "Relevant Sections": "Order VII Rule 10 (1) of the CPC:  \"Subject to the provisions of rule 10A, the plaint shall at any stage of the suit be returned to be presented to the Court in which the suit should have been instituted.\" \n Section 15(2) of the Commercial Courts Act: \"All suits and applications, including applications under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (26 of 1996), relating to a commercial dispute of a Specified Value pending in any civil court in any district or area in respect of which a Commercial Court has been constituted, shall be transferred to such Commercial Court: Provided that no suit or application where the final judgment has been reserved by the Court prior to the constitution of the Commercial Division or the Commercial Court shall be transferred either under sub- section (1) or sub-section (2).\"",
    "Context": "This query pertains to a legal issue concerning the proper forum for filing a commercial suit, specifically addressing the situation where a plaintiff mistakenly files a commercial suit in a civil court instead of a commercial court.
