    "Query": "A defendant in a commercial suit failed to file a written statement within the 120-day period stipulated by the Commercial Courts Act. The defendant now seeks to file a written statement, arguing that the High Court has inherent powers to condone delay under its Letters Patent and rules.",
    "Legal Principles": "The Commercial Courts Act aims to expedite commercial cases. Amendments to Order VIII of the CPC introduced by the Act are mandatory. The Act's provisions are intended to override High Court rules in cases of conflict. The High Court, in its Commercial Division, is bound by the provisions of the Commercial Courts Act.",
    "Relevant Sections": "Order VIII Rule 1 (as amended by the Commercial Courts Act): Provided further that where the defendant fails to file the written statement within the said period of thirty days, he shall be allowed to file the written statement on such other day, as may be specified by the Court, for reasons to be recorded in writing and on payment of such costs as the Court deems fit, but which shall not be later than one hundred twenty days from the date of service of summons and on expiry of one hundred twenty days from the date of service of summons, the defendant shall forfeit the right to file the written statement and the Court shall not allow the written statement to be taken on record.\n\nOrder VIII Rule 10: Provided that no Court shall make an order to extend the time provided under Rule 1 of this Order for filing of the written statement.\n\nSection 16 of the Commercial Courts Act: (3) Where any provision of any Rule of the jurisdictional High Court or any amendment to the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, by the State Government is in conflict with the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, as amended by this Act, the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure as amended by this Act shall prevail.",

    "Query": "A plaintiff in a commercial suit filed a plaint without disclosing all the documents in its possession, as mandated by Order XI Rule 1 of the CPC (as amended by the Commercial Courts Act). The defendant argues that the plaint should be rejected under Order VII Rule 11(d) as 'barred by any law'.",
    "Legal Principles": "Order XI of the CPC provides consequences for non-disclosure of documents, but does not constitute a 'bar in law' that would automatically lead to dismissal of the plaint. The Court can grant leave to rely on undisclosed documents upon establishing reasonable cause.",
    "Relevant Sections": "Order XI Rule 1: (5) The plaintiff shall not be allowed to rely on documents, which were in the plaintiff's power, possession, control or custody and not disclosed along with plaint or within the extended period set out above, save and except by leave of Court and such leave shall be granted only upon the plaintiff establishing reasonable cause for non-disclosure along with the plaint.",

    "Query": "A defendant in a commercial suit seeks to file a written statement after the 120-day period has elapsed. The defendant argues that they were unable to file the statement due to unforeseen circumstances, such as illness or negligence of their advocate. The defendant contends that the Court should exercise its discretion under Order VIII Rule 9 to condone the delay.",
    "Legal Principles": "The amended Order VIII Rule 1, as introduced by the Commercial Courts Act, is mandatory, and the Court has no discretion to condone delay beyond the 120-day period. Even Order VIII Rule 9 does not override this limitation. Exceptional circumstances, while considered previously, are no longer sufficient grounds for condonation of delay in commercial suits.",
    "Relevant Sections": "Order VIII Rule 1: Provided further that where the defendant fails to file the written statement within the said period of thirty days, he shall be allowed to file the written statement on such other day, as may be specified by the Court, for reasons to be recorded in writing and on payment of such costs as the Court deems fit, but which shall not be later than one hundred twenty days from the date of service of summons and on expiry of one hundred twenty days from the date of service of summons, the defendant shall forfeit the right to file the written statement and the Court shall not allow the written statement to be taken on record.\n\nOrder VIII Rule 9: No pleading subsequent to the written statement of a defendant other than by way of defence to a set-off or counter-claim shall be presented except by the leave of the Court and upon such terms as the Court thinks fit, but the Court may at any time require a written statement or additional written statement from any of the parties and fix a time for presenting the same.",

    "Query": "A company is involved in a commercial dispute with a foreign investor. The company seeks to avoid the jurisdiction of the Commercial Division of the High Court, arguing that it is not bound by the provisions of the Commercial Courts Act due to its special status as a registered company.",
    "Legal Principles": "The Commercial Courts Act applies to commercial disputes of a specified value, irrespective of the nature or status of the parties involved. The Act's provisions are intended to be applied uniformly across the country.",
    "Relevant Sections": "Section 11 of the Commercial Courts Act: Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, a Commercial Court or a Commercial Division shall not entertain or decide any suit, application or proceedings relating to any commercial dispute in respect of which the jurisdiction of the civil court is either expressly or impliedly barred under any other law for the time being in force.\n\nSection 21 of the Commercial Courts Act: Save as otherwise provided, the provisions of this Act shall have effect, notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any other law for the time being in force or in any instrument having effect by virtue of any law for the time being in force other than this Act.",

    "Query": "A defendant in a commercial suit filed a written statement after the 120-day period but within the 90-day period previously allowed for non-commercial suits. The defendant argues that the Commercial Courts Act did not expressly overturn the previous 90-day period, and therefore, the filing should be considered valid.",
    "Legal Principles": "The Commercial Courts Act introduced a uniform 120-day period for filing written statements in commercial suits, replacing the previous 90-day period for non-commercial suits. This amendment is mandatory and cannot be circumvented.",

    "Query": "A defendant in a commercial suit argues that the Court should exercise its inherent powers under Section 151 of the CPC to condone the delay in filing a written statement beyond the 120-day period, citing exceptional circumstances.",
    "Legal Principles": "The inherent powers of the Court under Section 151 cannot be used to override express statutory provisions, such as the mandatory time limits set by the Commercial Courts Act. The Court's inherent powers are meant to supplement, not supplant, statutory provisions.",
    "Relevant Sections": "Section 151 of the CPC: Notwithstanding anything contained in this Code, the Court shall have the power to make such orders as may be necessary for the ends of justice or to prevent abuse of the process of the court.",

    "Query": "A plaintiff in a commercial suit seeks to rely on a document that was not disclosed with the plaint, as mandated by Order XI Rule 1. The plaintiff argues that the document is relevant to a new issue raised by the defendant after the filing of the plaint.",
    "Legal Principles": "Order XI Rule 1, as amended by the Commercial Courts Act, mandates disclosure of all documents in the plaintiff's possession, control, or custody. The Court can grant leave to rely on undisclosed documents, but only if the plaintiff establishes reasonable cause for the non-disclosure.",
    "Relevant Sections": "Order XI Rule 1: (5) The plaintiff shall not be allowed to rely on documents, which were in the plaintiff's power, possession, control or custody and not disclosed along with plaint or within the extended period set out above, save and except by leave of Court and such leave shall be granted only upon the plaintiff establishing reasonable cause for non-disclosure along with the plaint.",

    "Query": "A plaintiff in a commercial suit argues that the Court should apply the provisions of Order XV-A of the Commercial Courts Act to require the defendant to file additional pleadings beyond the initial written statement, even after the 120-day period has elapsed.",
    "Legal Principles": "While Order XV-A empowers the Court to call for additional pleadings, it does not provide an exception to the mandatory time limit for filing a written statement under Order VIII Rule 1. The Court cannot use Order XV-A to circumvent the 120-day limitation.",
    "Relevant Sections": "Order XV-A: (1) The Court may, at any stage of the proceedings, after framing issues, or at any time before framing issues, if it considers it necessary or expedient for the efficient disposal of the suit, call upon any party to furnish further and better particulars of any pleading or to produce or give discovery of any document or other thing relating to the subject-matter of the suit or to give any other discovery or inspection. ...\n\nOrder VIII Rule 1: Provided further that where the defendant fails to file the written statement within the said period of thirty days, he shall be allowed to file the written statement on such other day, as may be specified by the Court, for reasons to be recorded in writing and on payment of such costs as the Court deems fit, but which shall not be later than one hundred twenty days from the date of service of summons and on expiry of one hundred twenty days from the date of service of summons, the defendant shall forfeit the right to file the written statement and the Court shall not allow the written statement to be taken on record.",

    "Query": "A defendant in a commercial suit seeks to argue that the 120-day period for filing a written statement should be calculated from the date they entered appearance, not the date of service of the summons. The defendant relies on a previous High Court notice that waived service upon appearance.",
    "Legal Principles": "The 120-day period for filing a written statement in commercial suits commences from the date of service of the summons, as explicitly stated in Order VIII Rule 1. Previous High Court notices or practices cannot override the statutory provisions of the Commercial Courts Act.",
    "Relevant Sections": "Order VIII Rule 1: Provided further that where the defendant fails to file the written statement within the said period of thirty days, he shall be allowed to file the written statement on such other day, as may be specified by the Court, for reasons to be recorded in writing and on payment of such costs as the Court deems fit, but which shall not be later than one hundred twenty days from the date of service of summons and on expiry of one hundred twenty days from the date of service of summons, the defendant shall forfeit the right to file the written statement and the Court shall not allow the written statement to be taken on record.",
