    "Legal Principles": "The Commercial Courts Act 2015 applies to "commercial disputes" defined in Section 2(1)(c) of the Act.

    "Legal Principles": "Product liability law holds manufacturers responsible for defective products. However, a manufacturer may avoid liability if the customer's misuse of the product was the proximate cause of the injury.
