    "Query": "A defendant filed a written statement after the statutory deadline without an application for condonation of delay. The plaintiff objected to the late filing. Can the court accept the written statement without a condonation application?",
    "Legal Principles": "The Commercial Courts Act, 2015, amended Order VI of the CPC, requiring a written statement to be filed within 30 days of summons service. The court can condone delays beyond 30 days but within 120 days, but only with a sufficient explanation and an application for condonation of delay.",
