The court needs to determine the correct jurisdiction.",
    "Legal Principles": "The court needs to determine whether the plaintiff has established a sufficient connection between the suit and Chennai to justify jurisdiction. Key considerations include the plaintiff's registered office, the defendants' activities within Chennai, the location of relevant evidence and witnesses, and the principle of forum non conveniens.",

Key principles include the presumption against retrospective application of legislation and the right of appeal as a substantive right.",
    "Relevant Sections": "Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act - This section outlines the appeal provisions for judgments and orders passed by Commercial Courts and Commercial Divisions.

Key factors include the plaintiff's business activities within Chennai, the nature of the alleged infringement, and the principle of forum non conveniens.",

The plaintiff counters that the injunction should remain as the court found a possibility of confusion.",
    "Legal Principles": "The court needs to assess whether the trial court erred in continuing the injunction. The court will consider the nature of the alleged infringement, the likelihood of confusion, and the principles governing the grant of interlocutory injunctions.",
    "Relevant Sections": "Order XXXIX Rule 1 and 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure - These rules govern the grant of injunctions in civil cases.
