    "Query": "A dispute has arisen between two companies, Alpha Corp and Beta Inc, over a contract for the supply of software services. Alpha Corp, based in Mumbai, claims that Beta Inc, based in Delhi, failed to deliver the software on time and according to specifications. Beta Inc argues that the delay was caused by Alpha Corp's failure to provide timely input and that the software meets the agreed-upon requirements. The contract includes an arbitration clause specifying Delhi as the seat of arbitration. Alpha Corp has filed a Section 9 application in the Mumbai High Court seeking an interim injunction to restrain Beta Inc from using the software until the dispute is resolved. Beta Inc has also filed a Section 9 application in the Delhi High Court seeking an interim injunction to prevent Alpha Corp from interfering with its use of the software. Both parties argue that their respective courts have exclusive jurisdiction under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, based on the seat of arbitration and the location of the cause of action.",
    "Legal Principles": "The legal principles relevant to this query include the interpretation of Section 2(1)(e) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, which defines 'Court' for the purposes of Part I of the Act, as well as the application of Section 42, which deals with jurisdiction in cases where applications under Part I have been made in a Court. The principle of party autonomy, as recognized in Swastik Gases v. Indian Oil Corporation Ltd., (2013) 9 SCC 32, also plays a role in determining the extent to which parties can agree on exclusive jurisdiction clauses. The Supreme Court's decisions in BALCO (2012) 9 SCC 552 and Datawind (2017) 7 SCC 678, which dealt with the interplay between the seat of arbitration and forum selection clauses, are key precedents in this context.",
    "Relevant Sections": "**Section 2(1)(e) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996**: Defines 'Court' for the purposes of Part I of the Act, granting jurisdiction to both the court where the cause of action is located and the court where the arbitration takes place. \n **Section 42 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996**:  States that if any application under Part I has been made in a Court, that Court alone shall have jurisdiction over the arbitral proceedings and all subsequent applications arising out of that agreement. \n **Article 20 of the arbitration agreement**:  Specifies the seat of arbitration and may include an exclusive jurisdiction clause.",
    "Context": "The query involves a dispute arising out of a commercial contract between two companies based in different jurisdictions. The contract contains an arbitration clause designating a specific seat, which raises questions regarding exclusive jurisdiction in relation to Section 9 applications filed in different courts."

    "Query": "Two parties, Gamma Ltd and Delta Corp, have entered into a construction contract with an arbitration clause specifying Mumbai as the seat of arbitration. A dispute arises when Gamma Ltd alleges that Delta Corp failed to meet certain construction deadlines. Gamma Ltd, based in Delhi, files a Section 9 application in the Delhi High Court seeking an injunction to prevent Delta Corp from continuing construction until the dispute is resolved. Delta Corp, based in Bangalore, argues that the Delhi High Court lacks jurisdiction because the seat of arbitration is Mumbai and the contract does not explicitly mention an exclusive forum selection clause. Gamma Ltd argues that the Delhi High Court has concurrent jurisdiction as the cause of action arose in Delhi.",
    "Legal Principles": "The key legal principle in this case is the interpretation of Section 2(1)(e) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, which grants jurisdiction to both the court where the cause of action is located and the court where the arbitration takes place. The Supreme Court's decisions in BALCO (2012) 9 SCC 552 and Datawind (2017) 7 SCC 678 are relevant in determining whether the seat of arbitration automatically confers exclusive jurisdiction. The principle of party autonomy, as discussed in Swastik Gases (2013) 9 SCC 32, is also relevant in determining the extent to which parties can agree on exclusive jurisdiction.",
    "Relevant Sections": "**Section 2(1)(e) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996**: Defines 'Court' for the purposes of Part I of the Act, granting jurisdiction to both the court where the cause of action is located and the court where the arbitration takes place. \n **Section 42 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996**:  States that if any application under Part I has been made in a Court, that Court alone shall have jurisdiction over the arbitral proceedings and all subsequent applications arising out of that agreement. \n **Article 20 of the arbitration agreement**:  Specifies the seat of arbitration and may include an exclusive jurisdiction clause.",
    "Context": "This case involves a dispute arising from a construction contract with an arbitration clause designating a specific seat. The question of jurisdiction arises when one party files a Section 9 application in a court different from the seat of arbitration, leading to a debate about concurrent jurisdiction based on the location of the cause of action."

    "Query": "Two parties, Epsilon LLC and Zeta Corp, are involved in a dispute over a technology licensing agreement. The agreement specifies New Delhi as the seat of arbitration and includes an exclusive jurisdiction clause in favor of the Delhi High Court. Epsilon LLC, based in Chennai, seeks to enforce certain provisions of the agreement, while Zeta Corp, based in Bangalore, challenges the validity of those provisions. Epsilon LLC files a Section 9 application in the Chennai High Court seeking interim relief, arguing that the exclusive jurisdiction clause only applies to disputes arising from the arbitration process itself, not the underlying agreement. Zeta Corp contends that the exclusive jurisdiction clause encompasses all disputes arising under the agreement, including those related to enforcement.",
    "Legal Principles": "This case involves the interpretation of exclusive jurisdiction clauses in arbitration agreements, specifically in the context of Section 9 applications. The relevant legal principles include the balance between party autonomy and the limitations on forum selection clauses under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. The Supreme Court's decision in Datawind (2017) 7 SCC 678, which dealt with the impact of exclusive jurisdiction clauses in arbitration agreements, is particularly relevant. The principle of comity of courts, as illustrated in Priya Hiranandani Vandervala v Niranjan Hiranandani 2016 (4) Arb LR 18 (Del) (DB), also plays a role in determining which court should first address a dispute.",
