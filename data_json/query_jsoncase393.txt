    "Query": "A contractor, ABC Construction, claims payment for a delayed construction project. The owner, XYZ Corporation, claims compensation for the delay and argues that the arbitrator incorrectly calculated the delay compensation based on the contract's provisions. How should the court approach the review of the arbitrator's decision on delay compensation?",
    "Legal Principles": "Judicial review of arbitral awards is limited. Courts can only interfere on grounds such as patent illegality, breach of natural justice, or where the award is contrary to public policy. Arbitrators have wide discretion in interpreting contracts and determining factual issues. Courts should respect the arbitrator's expertise and not substitute their own judgment on matters of contract interpretation or factual findings.",
    "Relevant Sections": "Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, outlines the grounds for challenging an arbitral award. These grounds include the award being contrary to public policy, the arbitrator exceeding his jurisdiction, or the award being based on a patently illegal or incorrect interpretation of the contract.",
