    "Query": "A construction company, awarded a contract for a road project by the State government, failed to complete the project within the stipulated timeframe. The State government rescinded the contract and the company invoked arbitration proceedings, claiming damages for breach of contract. The Arbitral Tribunal ruled in favor of the company, but the State government filed an appeal against the award, arguing that the company's delay was unjustified. The State government filed the appeal beyond the statutory limitation period and seeks condonation of delay. What are the legal principles governing condonation of delay in such cases, particularly when the party seeking condonation is a government entity?",
    "Legal Principles": "Condonation of delay is governed by Section 5 of the Limitation Act, 1963. The court has the discretion to condone delay, but it must be satisfied that sufficient cause has been shown. The burden of proof lies on the party seeking condonation. In the case of a government entity, the court may take a stricter approach and require a more compelling reason for condonation of delay.",

    "Query": "A company entered into a contract with the State government for the supply of goods. The company failed to deliver the goods on time, and the State government terminated the contract. The company filed an arbitration claim seeking damages for wrongful termination. The Arbitral Tribunal ruled in favor of the company, but the State government filed an appeal against the award, arguing that the company was in breach of contract. The State government filed the appeal beyond the statutory limitation period and seeks condonation of delay, claiming that the delay was due to internal departmental processes. Can the State government's argument be accepted, and what is the legal standard for condonation of delay in such circumstances?",
    "Legal Principles": "The court must be satisfied that the delay was caused by sufficient cause, and that the party seeking condonation exercised due diligence. The usual explanation of red tapism and internal departmental processes may not be sufficient to constitute sufficient cause. The government is expected to exercise due diligence and ensure that its legal proceedings are filed within the stipulated time frame.",

The company filed a review application before the High Court, but it was also dismissed. The company now seeks to file a fresh appeal before the High Court against the dismissal of its review application. Can the company file a fresh appeal, and if so, what are the limitations applicable?",
    "Legal Principles": "A review application is not a substantive right, but a discretionary remedy. There is no right to appeal against the dismissal of a review application.
