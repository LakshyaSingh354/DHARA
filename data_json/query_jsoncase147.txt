    "Query": "A government company, Dholera Industrial City Development Limited, terminated a works contract with a contractor, M/S SPML Infra Ltd., due to delays.

The Arbitral Tribunal dismissed the government company's application to decide the jurisdiction issue as a preliminary issue. Can the government company challenge this decision through a writ petition?",
