    "Query": "A buyer of timber, relying on a Letter of Credit issued by a bank, seeks to stop payment due to alleged fraud by the seller. The seller has not responded, and the bank claims it negotiated the Letter of Credit. Can the buyer obtain an injunction to prevent payment?",

The issuing bank's obligation to pay under the Letter of Credit is generally independent of any fraud in the underlying transaction.  To interdict payment, the buyer must show egregious fraud by the negotiating bank, or knowledge of the fraud by the bank.",

State Bank of Patiala (2006) 5 SCC 416 (holding that fraud discovered after Letter of Credit negotiation is not a defense), Allahabad Bank v. Malayan Banking Limited (2019 SCC OnLine Del 11447) (reaffirming the principle of UBS AG), Millenium Wires Private Limited v. State Trading Corporation of India Limited & Ors.
