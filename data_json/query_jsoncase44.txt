    "Query": "A defendant in a patent infringement suit filed an application under Order VII Rule 11 CPC challenging the maintainability of the plaint. The application was dismissed by the Commercial Court. Subsequently, the defendant filed a written statement but missed the 120-day deadline due to the pending Order VII Rule 11 CPC application.
