    "Query": "A company based in India seeks to enforce a foreign arbitration award against a US-based company. The award was rendered by an arbitration tribunal in London, but the Indian company is facing resistance in enforcing the award in India, arguing that the Indian courts lack jurisdiction.

This jurisdiction is generally determined based on the provisions of the Arbitration Act and the location of the parties or the assets. ",
