    "Query": "A contractor is seeking an injunction to prevent a property owner from terminating their contract. The contractor claims that the owner is trying to terminate the contract without proper justification and that this would cause them irreparable harm. The owner argues that the contractor has breached the contract and that they are entitled to terminate it. What are the legal principles that govern the issuance of injunctions in contract termination cases? Is the High Court justified in interfering with a decision made by the Commercial Court under Section 9 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act?",
    "Legal Principles": "The issuance of injunctions in contract termination cases is governed by the principles of equity and the need to prevent irreparable harm. The court will consider factors such as the likelihood of success on the merits, the balance of convenience, and the possibility of irreparable harm if the injunction is not granted. The High Court's power under Article 227 of the Constitution is limited, and it will generally not interfere with decisions made by lower courts unless there is a jurisdictional error or a clear violation of legal principles.",
