    "Query": "A construction company has invoked performance bank guarantees issued by a contractor for a delay in project completion. The contractor argues that the delay was due to unforeseen circumstances beyond their control and seeks to prevent the bank guarantees from being encashed. What are the legal principles that govern the invocation of performance bank guarantees in such cases, and what are the relevant sections of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 applicable?",
    "Legal Principles": "The invocation of performance bank guarantees is governed by the principles of contract law and the provisions of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. The courts have held that performance bank guarantees are typically unconditional and irrevocable, and the bank is obligated to pay the beneficiary upon demand, unless there is a valid claim of fraud or misrepresentation. However, the courts have also recognized that there may be exceptional circumstances where a party may be able to prevent the invocation of a bank guarantee, such as when the delay is due to circumstances beyond their control and they have taken all reasonable steps to mitigate the damage.",
    "Relevant Sections": "Section 9 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 deals with interim measures that can be sought by a party before or during arbitral proceedings. This section allows the court to order interim measures, including the preservation of property, securing the amount in dispute, and the issuance of interim injunctions. The court's power to grant interim measures under Section 9 is subject to certain principles, including the need to balance the equities between the parties and the requirement that the measure sought is just and convenient.",

    "Query": "A company has filed an arbitration claim against its supplier for defective goods, and the supplier has invoked the bank guarantee issued by the company. The company argues that the supplier's invocation of the bank guarantee is premature, as the arbitration proceedings have not yet commenced. Can the company seek an injunction to restrain the supplier from encashing the bank guarantee pending the arbitration proceedings?",
    "Legal Principles": "The invocation of a bank guarantee is generally considered to be unconditional and irrevocable. However, the courts have recognized that in exceptional circumstances, such as when the invocation is premature or if there is a strong case of fraud, an injunction may be granted to restrain the beneficiary from encashing the bank guarantee pending the resolution of the underlying dispute.",

    "Query": "A party has been directed by the court to deposit a certain amount in connection with an arbitration case. The party argues that the court's order is an unreasonable restriction on its financial freedom and that it will cause irreparable harm to its business. Can the party challenge the court's order on the grounds of excessive financial burden?",
    "Legal Principles": "The courts have the power to grant interim measures, including orders for the deposit of funds, in arbitration proceedings. However, this power is subject to the principle of proportionality, meaning that the order should be proportionate to the legitimate interests of the parties involved. The court must balance the competing interests of the parties and ensure that the order does not impose an unreasonable financial burden on any party.",
