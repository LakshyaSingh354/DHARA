    "Query": "A company is suing another company for trademark infringement, but the value of the suit is below Rs. 3 lakhs. Should the case be heard by a Commercial Court or a non-Commercial Court?",
    "Legal Principles": "The Commercial Courts Act, 2015 (CCA) establishes Commercial Courts for adjudicating 'commercial disputes' of a 'specified value', which is currently set at Rs. 3 lakhs or above. Intellectual property rights disputes are considered 'commercial disputes' under the CCA. However, the Trade Marks Act, 1999, requires suits for trademark infringement to be filed only in a District Court, irrespective of the pecuniary value. This creates a conflict between the CCA and the Trade Marks Act.",
    "Relevant Sections": "Section 2(c)(xvii) of the CCA defines 'commercial dispute' to include intellectual property rights. Section 2(i) of the CCA defines 'specified value' as the value of the subject matter in a suit as determined in accordance with Section 12. Section 134 of the Trade Marks Act mandates that trademark infringement suits be filed in a District Court, not inferior to a District Court, regardless of the monetary value.",
    "Context": "This query relates to a trademark infringement case with a value below the specified value under the CCA. It requires determining the appropriate court for adjudication considering the conflict between the CCA and the Trade Marks Act."

    "Query": "A plaintiff has deliberately undervalued their intellectual property suit to avoid being subject to the stringent procedures of the Commercial Courts Act. Can the court intervene and re-value the suit?",
    "Legal Principles": "The plaintiff has the right to choose the forum for their suit and to value the suit as they deem appropriate. However, this right is not absolute. The court can intervene if the valuation is arbitrary or unreasonable and appears to be an attempt to avoid the provisions of the Commercial Courts Act. Such undervaluation can be considered an abuse of process and forum shopping.",
    "Relevant Sections": "The court can examine the valuation to ensure it is not arbitrary or unreasonable. Section 12 of the CCA provides for determining the specified value of intangible rights as estimated by the plaintiff. The court can consider the market value of the intellectual property involved in the dispute to determine if the valuation is justified.",
    "Context": "This query focuses on the court's ability to review the valuation of an intellectual property suit where the plaintiff is suspected of undervaluing the suit to avoid the Commercial Courts Act. It involves balancing the plaintiff's right to value the suit with the court's responsibility to prevent abuse of process."
