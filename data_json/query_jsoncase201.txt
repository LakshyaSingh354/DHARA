    "Query": "A construction company filed a suit against the state government for non-payment of dues related to a public project. The suit was dismissed by the Commercial Court, and the company appealed the decision. However, the appeal was dismissed as withdrawn with liberty to file a fresh appeal within 3 months after correcting certain defects in the judgment. The company filed the fresh appeal after 1022 days, claiming the delay was due to the time taken to correct the judgment. Is the company's appeal barred by limitation?",
    "Legal Principles": "The Commercial Courts Act, 2015 aims for expeditious disposal of commercial disputes. The statute mandates a strict 60-day limitation period for appeals. Condonation of delay under Section 5 of the Limitation Act is exceptional, requiring bona fide action and absence of negligence. The interpretation of 'sufficient cause' for condoning delay considers factors such as diligence and lack of negligent conduct. Order XXIII Rule 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure specifies that when liberty to file a fresh suit is granted, limitation is counted from the original judgment's date, not the liberty grant date. ",
    "Relevant Sections": "Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 (deals with appeals from Commercial Courts), Section 5 of the Limitation Act, 1963 (condonation of delay), Order XXIII Rule 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure (fresh suits and limitation), ",
    "Context": "This case involves a commercial dispute between a construction company and the state government, concerning an appeal against a Commercial Court judgment. The issue is whether the 1022-day delay in filing the appeal is condonable."

    "Query": "A company sued another company for breach of contract. The Commercial Court dismissed the suit, finding the plaintiff's claim lacked merit. The plaintiff appealed the decision. The defendant argued that the appeal was barred by limitation as it was filed beyond the 60-day statutory period prescribed by the Commercial Courts Act. The plaintiff claimed the delay was due to unforeseen circumstances beyond their control, citing a sudden illness of their legal counsel. Would this be considered a sufficient cause for condonation of delay?",
    "Legal Principles": "The Commercial Courts Act, 2015 mandates a strict 60-day limitation period for appeals.  Condonation of delay under Section 5 of the Limitation Act requires 'sufficient cause' - a reason the party could not be blamed for the delay. This includes situations where there's bona fide action, diligence, and the absence of negligence. The Court considers the specific circumstances and assesses if the party acted diligently despite unforeseen obstacles. ",

    "Query": "Two parties entered into a commercial agreement. One party breached the agreement, and the other party filed a suit in the Commercial Court seeking damages. The Court granted the relief sought by the plaintiff. The defendant appealed the decision. The defendant's appeal was filed 100 days after the judgment. The defendant argued that they had approached the wrong appellate forum initially, causing the delay. They sought condonation of delay under Section 14 of the Limitation Act. Would this be a valid ground to condone the delay?",
    "Legal Principles": "Section 14 of the Limitation Act allows exclusion of time spent in a bona fide proceeding before an incorrect forum. However, this requires the applicant to demonstrate that they prosecuted the case with due diligence. The court scrutinizes the applicant's actions to ensure they weren't negligent or lacked bona fides. ",

    "Query": "A company entered into a contract with a government agency for construction work. The agency failed to make timely payments, leading the company to file a suit in the Commercial Court. The Court ruled in favor of the company, ordering the agency to pay the dues. The agency appealed the decision. The appeal was filed 90 days after the judgment, citing bureaucratic delays within the government agency for obtaining the necessary approvals to file the appeal. Would this explanation be sufficient to condone the delay?",
    "Legal Principles": "The concept of 'sufficient cause' for condonation of delay requires a genuine reason for the delay, beyond the party's control. It emphasizes diligence and bona fide action, with negligence being a factor against condonation. While bureaucratic delays can be a factor, the court examines the specifics to assess if the party acted diligently and wasn't negligent. ",

    "Query": "A business partnership agreement dispute led to one partner filing a suit against the other in the Commercial Court. The Court ruled in favor of the plaintiff partner, ordering the defendant partner to pay a sum of money. The defendant partner appealed the decision. The defendant argued that they had been misled by their legal counsel, who assured them they had more time to appeal. The appeal was filed 70 days after the judgment. Would this explanation be sufficient to condoning the delay?",
    "Legal Principles": "While relying on legal advice can be a factor in condonation, the court examines the reasonability of the reliance. The applicant must demonstrate that they acted diligently based on the counsel's advice, not simply relying on it without any independent verification or inquiry. The court assesses if the reliance was bona fide and not due to negligence or indifference. ",

    "Query": "A company imported goods from another country and was involved in a dispute with the customs department over the payment of import duties. The company filed a suit in the Commercial Court, which ruled in favor of the customs department. The company appealed the decision. The appeal was filed 85 days after the judgment, claiming that the delay was caused due to the complex nature of the legal arguments and the time required to gather relevant documentation. Would this explanation be sufficient to condone the delay?",
    "Legal Principles": "The complexity of legal issues and the need to gather evidence can be considered in condonation of delay. However, the court expects the party to demonstrate diligent efforts, such as initiating the appeal process promptly and actively pursuing the necessary documentation.

Would this explanation be sufficient to condone the delay?",
    "Legal Principles": "Negotiating a settlement can be considered a factor in condonation of delay. However, the court scrutinizes the genuineness and diligence of the negotiation efforts. It evaluates if the negotiations were actively pursued and if the company was genuinely attempting to resolve the dispute rather than simply delaying the appeal. ",
