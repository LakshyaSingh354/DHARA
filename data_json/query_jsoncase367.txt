It states that all suits relating to a commercial dispute of a Specified Value pending in any civil court in a district where a Commercial Court has been constituted shall be transferred to such Commercial Court. However, the Act also provides for exceptions to the transfer, such as cases where the final judgment has been reserved by the court prior to the constitution of the Commercial Court.",
