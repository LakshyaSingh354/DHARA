    "Query": "A company has been issued a demand certificate for the enforcement of a guarantee, but they argue that the transaction involving the guarantee is part of a larger illegal scheme and therefore unenforceable. They have been granted conditional leave to defend the suit, but they are appealing for unconditional leave.  What are the legal principles governing the granting of leave to defend in summary suits?",
    "Legal Principles": "The principles governing granting of leave to defend in summary suits under Order XXXVII of the Code of Civil Procedure (CPC) are as follows:\n\n1. **Good Defence on Merits**: If the defendant can show a good defence to the claim, the plaintiff is not entitled to leave to sign judgment, and the defendant is entitled to unconditional leave to defend.\n\n2. **Triable Issue**: Even if the defendant does not have a good defence, they may still be entitled to unconditional leave to defend if they raise a triable issue, indicating a fair, bona fide, or reasonable defence.\n\n3. **Sufficient Facts to Defend**: If the defendant discloses facts that suggest they may be able to establish a defence at trial, they may be entitled to conditional leave to defend. In such cases, the court may impose conditions on the time or mode of trial, but not payment into court or furnishing security.\n\n4. **No Defence or Illusory Defence**: If the defendant has no defence or the defence is illusory, sham, or practically moonshine, the plaintiff is ordinarily entitled to leave to sign judgment.\n\n5. **Protecting the Plaintiff**: In cases where the defendant has no defence or the defence is illusory, the court may still protect the plaintiff by granting leave to defend only on condition that the defendant pays the amount claimed into court or otherwise secures it.\n\nThe court must consider whether the defendant has raised a triable issue that requires further investigation and evidence, and balance the interests of both parties.",

    "Query": "A construction company is being sued for breach of contract. The contract involves a complex payment scheme with multiple parties and includes clauses regarding force majeure events. The plaintiff is seeking summary judgment. What are the key legal issues and arguments the defendant can raise to avoid summary judgment?",
    "Legal Principles": "The defendant can raise the following key legal issues and arguments to avoid summary judgment in a breach of contract case involving a complex payment scheme and force majeure clauses:\n\n1. **Genuine Issue of Material Fact**: The defendant must demonstrate that there is a genuine issue of material fact in dispute that requires a trial to resolve. This could involve, for instance, the interpretation of the contract terms, the existence and applicability of force majeure events, or the nature and extent of the defendant's breach.\n\n2. **Force Majeure Defence**: If the contract contains force majeure clauses, the defendant can argue that the breach was caused by an event outside their control that was unforeseen and unavoidable. This would require evidence to prove the occurrence and impact of the force majeure event.\n\n3. **Payment Scheme Interpretation**: The defendant can argue for a different interpretation of the complex payment scheme than that presented by the plaintiff. This might involve evidence of industry practices, prior dealings between the parties, or other relevant circumstances.\n\n4. **Causation and Damages**: The defendant can challenge the plaintiff's claim that the defendant's actions caused the alleged damages. This might involve evidence of other contributing factors or the plaintiff's failure to mitigate damages.\n\n5. **Waiver or Estoppel**: The defendant can argue that the plaintiff waived their right to enforce the contract or is estopped from claiming damages due to their actions or statements.\n\n6. **Defective Contract Formation**: The defendant can challenge the validity of the contract itself, arguing that there was a defect in its formation, such as a lack of consideration, mutual assent, or capacity.",

    "Query": "A company is being sued for intellectual property infringement. The plaintiff claims that the defendant's product infringes on their registered trademark. The defendant argues that their product is not confusingly similar and that the plaintiff's trademark is not valid. What are the legal principles and arguments the defendant can raise to defend against the claim?",
    "Legal Principles": "The defendant can raise the following legal principles and arguments to defend against a trademark infringement claim:\n\n1. **Lack of Confusion**: The defendant must prove that their product is not confusingly similar to the plaintiff's product. This requires an analysis of the overall impression created by both products, considering factors such as the mark's appearance, sound, and meaning, as well as the goods or services offered. \n\n2. **Fair Use**: The defendant can argue that their use of the mark is fair use, such as for descriptive purposes or to identify the source of the goods or services. This requires a showing that the use is not likely to cause confusion.\n\n3. **Trademark Validity**: The defendant can challenge the validity of the plaintiff's trademark, arguing that it is not distinctive, descriptive, or generic. This requires evidence to support the argument that the mark does not meet the legal requirements for registration.\n\n4. **Laches and Estoppel**: The defendant can argue that the plaintiff is barred from asserting their claim due to laches (unreasonable delay) or estoppel (actions or statements that create a false impression). This requires evidence of the plaintiff's delay and any prejudice caused to the defendant.\n\n5. **First Sale Doctrine**: If the plaintiff's trademark is on a product that has been sold in the United States, the defendant can argue that they are not infringing by selling the same product. The first sale doctrine allows the owner of a trademarked product to sell or distribute it without the trademark owner's permission once the product has been sold in the United States.  ",

    "Query": "A software company is being sued for breach of contract. The plaintiff claims that the defendant failed to deliver a software product that met the agreed-upon specifications. The defendant argues that the software was delivered on time and that the plaintiff failed to adequately test it. What are the key legal issues and arguments the defendant can raise to defend against the claim?",
    "Legal Principles": "The defendant can raise the following legal issues and arguments to defend against a breach of contract claim in a software development case:\n\n1. **Meeting the Specifications**: The defendant can argue that they delivered the software product on time and that it met the agreed-upon specifications. This would require evidence of the software's functionality and a comparison to the agreed-upon specifications.\n\n2. **Plaintiff's Failure to Test**: The defendant can argue that the plaintiff failed to adequately test the software product and therefore cannot claim that it did not meet the specifications. This requires evidence that the plaintiff did not follow agreed-upon testing procedures or that their testing was insufficient.\n\n3. **Change of Scope**: The defendant can argue that the scope of the project was changed during development, which resulted in a delay or deviation from the original specifications. This would require evidence of the scope changes and their impact on the project.\n\n4. **Force Majeure**: The defendant can argue that the delay in delivery was caused by events outside their control, such as natural disasters, pandemics, or economic downturns. This would require evidence of the force majeure event and its impact on the project.\n\n5. **Mitigation of Damages**: The defendant can argue that the plaintiff failed to mitigate damages by taking steps to minimize their losses after the breach. This could involve seeking alternative software solutions or taking steps to minimize the impact of the delay.\n\n6. **Contract Interpretation**: The defendant can argue for a different interpretation of the contract terms regarding delivery timelines, testing procedures, or the scope of the project. This would require a careful analysis of the contract language and any relevant industry standards.",
