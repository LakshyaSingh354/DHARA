    "Query": "A construction company sued an oil company for breach of contract. The arbitration proceedings commenced under the old Arbitration Act, 1940, but continued under the new Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. The arbitrator issued an award, but the oil company challenged its validity arguing that the arbitrator lacked jurisdiction to apply the new Act. The case is now before me, the judge, and I need to determine if the arbitrator had the authority to apply the new Act.",
    "Legal Principles": "The applicability of the new Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 in cases where arbitration proceedings commenced under the old Act, 1940 depends on the agreement of the parties. The parties may agree to the applicability of the new Act even before it comes into force.",
    "Relevant Sections": "Section 85(2)(a) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 states that the provisions of the old Act shall apply in relation to arbitral proceedings which commenced before the new Act came into force unless otherwise agreed by the parties.",
    "Context": "This case is a dispute over the applicability of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 in an arbitration proceeding that commenced under the old Act, 1940."

    "Query": "A party to an arbitration agreement filed a petition to challenge the validity of an arbitral award. The award was passed under the new Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, but the petitioner argued that the proceedings should have been conducted under the old Act, 1940.  The petition was dismissed. The petitioner now seeks to raise the same objections in an execution proceeding against the award. Can the petitioner raise these objections again, even though they were previously dismissed?",
    "Legal Principles": "The principle of res judicata prevents parties from raising the same issue in subsequent proceedings if the issue has already been decided by a competent court.  However, objections based on a lack of jurisdiction can sometimes be raised at later stages.",
    "Relevant Sections": "Section 47 of the Code of Civil Procedure (CPC) deals with questions to be determined by the Court executing a decree. However, an arbitral award is not considered a decree under Section 2(2) of the CPC.",
    "Context": "This case concerns the enforceability of an arbitral award and the potential for a party to challenge the award's validity during the execution proceedings."

    "Query": "A commercial dispute arose between two companies, and the parties agreed to resolve it through arbitration.  The arbitration proceedings were conducted under the new Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, and the arbitrator issued an award in favor of one party.  The losing party filed an objection to the award under Section 34 of the Act, but the objection was dismissed. The losing party now seeks to challenge the award during the execution proceedings, arguing that the award is not a decree under Section 2(2) of the Code of Civil Procedure (CPC). Is this argument valid?",
    "Legal Principles": "An arbitral award is not a decree under Section 2(2) of the CPC.  However, it can be enforced under Section 36 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, using the provisions of the CPC as if it were a decree.",
    "Relevant Sections": "Section 2(2) of the CPC defines a decree.  Section 36 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 provides for the enforcement of arbitral awards.",
    "Context": "This case involves the interpretation of the legal nature of an arbitral award and its enforceability in execution proceedings."

    "Query": "A company filed a claim against another company for damages arising from a construction project. The parties agreed to arbitration, and the arbitration proceedings commenced under the old Arbitration Act, 1940. However, the parties subsequently agreed to continue the proceedings under the new Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. The arbitrator issued an award, but the company challenging the award argues that the arbitrator lacked jurisdiction to apply the new Act. How should the court handle this challenge?",
    "Legal Principles": "The court should examine the arbitration agreement to determine if the parties agreed to the applicability of the new Act. If the agreement explicitly states that the parties agreed to the application of "statutory re-enactments or modifications", this would likely be considered an agreement to apply the new Act, even if the proceedings started under the old Act.",
    "Relevant Sections": "Section 85(2)(a) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 is relevant.  The court should also consider Section 9.1.1.0 of the Agreement of Contract, which may contain an arbitration clause relevant to this issue.",
    "Context": "This case concerns a challenge to an arbitral award based on the alleged lack of jurisdiction of the arbitrator to apply the new Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, in a case that began under the old Act."

    "Query": "Two companies are involved in a commercial dispute over a contract. They agreed to resolve the dispute through arbitration, and the proceedings commenced under the old Arbitration Act, 1940.  However, the arbitrator decided to continue the proceedings under the new Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, without explicit consent from both parties.  One company now challenges the award, arguing that the arbitrator lacked the authority to apply the new Act. How should the court analyze this challenge?",
    "Legal Principles": "The court will likely analyze the arbitration agreement to determine if the parties agreed to the application of the new Act, even if the proceedings started under the old Act.  If the agreement contains language that suggests a willingness to apply "statutory re-enactments or modifications", this could be considered implicit consent.  The court may also consider the parties' actions and conduct during the proceedings, such as if they participated without objection.",
    "Relevant Sections": "Section 85(2)(a) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, which deals with the applicability of the new Act in cases where proceedings commenced under the old Act, is key.  The court will also examine the arbitration clause within the contract.",

    "Query": "In a construction contract dispute, the parties agreed to arbitration. The arbitration proceedings began under the old Arbitration Act, 1940, but continued under the new Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.  The arbitrator issued an award, but one party seeks to challenge the award, arguing that the proceedings should have remained under the old Act and that the arbitrator lacked jurisdiction to apply the new Act. The party claims that no agreement to apply the new Act was reached.  How should the court decide this matter?",
    "Legal Principles": "The court should examine the arbitration agreement to determine if the parties agreed to the application of the new Act. The court will also consider the parties' conduct during the proceedings.  If the agreement contains language that refers to applying "statutory re-enactments or modifications" and the parties continued the proceedings without objecting to the new Act's application, the court may find that the parties implicitly agreed to the application of the new Act.",
