    "Query": "A plaintiff filed a suit for recovery of money. The defendant, in their written statement, claimed a set-off for damages due to the plaintiff's breach of contract. The plaintiff argues that the defendant's claim for set-off is time-barred. Is the defendant's claim for set-off barred by the Limitation Act?",
    "Legal Principles": "The Limitation Act, 1963 governs the time period within which legal claims must be filed.  A set-off is a claim by a defendant against the plaintiff to reduce or extinguish the plaintiff's claim. An equitable set-off may be available even where a legal set-off is time-barred, but it is discretionary and may be refused by the court.",
    "Relevant Sections": "Section 3(2)(b)(i) of the Limitation Act, 1963: \"The period of limitation for an action by a defendant for the recovery of any sum of money due to him from the plaintiff shall be the same period as is prescribed for an action by the plaintiff for the recovery of the sum of money due to him from the defendant, or such shorter period as may be prescribed by any law for the time being in force.\"",

    "Legal Principles": "The court has discretion to allow amendments to pleadings, but this discretion should be exercised judiciously.

However, the court may consider factors such as the reason for the delay, the prejudice to the parties, and whether the amendment would serve the interests of justice.",
    "Relevant Sections": "Order VI, Rule 17 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908: \"The Court may at any stage of the proceedings, allow either party to alter or amend his pleading in such manner and on such terms as may be just, and all such amendments shall be made as may be necessary for the purpose of determining the real questions in controversy between the parties.\"",
