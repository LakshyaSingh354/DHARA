    "Query": "A plaintiff filed a suit against a defendant for breach of contract. The suit was valued at Rs. 2,00,000. The defendant argued that the suit should be treated as a 'Commercial Suit' under the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, and therefore, the appeal should lie before the Commercial Appellate Division of the High Court. However, the plaintiff argued that the suit was not a 'Commercial Suit' as the value of the subject matter was below the specified value of Rs. 3,00,000. Which party is correct?",
    "Legal Principles": "The Commercial Courts Act, 2015, provides for the creation of Commercial Courts to expedite the resolution of commercial disputes. However, the Act applies only to 'Commercial Suits' of a 'Specified Value'. The 'Specified Value' is defined as the value of the subject-matter of the suit, which shall not be less than Rs. 3,00,000.  The parties cannot, by their consent or conduct, vest jurisdiction in a Court that lacks jurisdiction.",
    "Relevant Sections": "Section 6 of the Act states that the Commercial Courts shall have jurisdiction to try all Suits and applications relating to a 'Commercial Dispute of a specified value'. Section 2(1)(i) of the Act defines 'Specified Value' as the value of the subject matter in respect of the Suit which shall not be less than Rs. 3,00,000.",

The plaintiff argued that the suit was wrongly renumbered and it should be treated as an Ordinary Suit. Which party is correct?",
    "Legal Principles": "The mere fact that a suit is numbered as a Commercial Suit or dealt with by the parties or even by the Court as a Commercial Suit would not convert it to a 'Commercial Suit' of a specified value and/or vest jurisdiction in a Commercial Court.
