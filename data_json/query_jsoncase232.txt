    "Query": "A developer has entered into a development agreement with a landowner to develop a property for residential use. The landowner has failed to fulfill certain obligations under the agreement, and the developer seeks specific performance of the agreement. The developer claims the agreement is primarily a development agreement rather than a simple construction contract, arguing that it involves the transfer of rights in the land for a monetary consideration. The landowner argues that the agreement is a construction contract and falls under the jurisdiction of the Commercial Courts Act. Which court has jurisdiction to hear the case? ",
    "Legal Principles": "The Commercial Courts Act, 2015, defines 'commercial dispute' and specifies jurisdiction of Commercial Courts for such disputes.  The Act considers agreements relating to immovable property 'used exclusively in trade or commerce' as commercial disputes, and the 'used' implies actual use, not potential or future use.  The Supreme Court has held that development agreements may be of various kinds, and in cases where an interest in land is created in favor of the developer, it might not be a simple construction contract, but rather a development agreement that could be specifically enforced.",
    "Relevant Sections": "Section 2 (1) (c) (vii) of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, defines 'commercial dispute' to include agreements relating to immovable property used exclusively in trade or commerce.  Explanation (a) clarifies that a commercial dispute does not cease to be a commercial dispute merely because it involves action for recovery of immovable property or realization of monies out of immovable property.  Section 6 confers jurisdiction on Commercial Courts for 'all suits and applications relating to a commercial dispute.'",
