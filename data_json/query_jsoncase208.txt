    "Query": "A contractor was awarded a contract for road construction in a rural area. The contract was terminated by the government agency due to alleged delays and substandard work. The contractor claims the delays were caused by unforeseen circumstances, and the work meets the contract specifications. The contractor has filed a petition to set aside the arbitral award which ruled in favor of the government agency. The agency argues that the delay was unreasonable and that the work did not meet the standards. Is the contractor's petition to set aside the arbitral award likely to be successful?",
    "Legal Principles": "The legal principles involved in this case include the interpretation of Section 34(3) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, regarding the time limit for challenging an arbitral award. It also involves the concept of 'sufficient cause' for condoning the delay, as per the proviso to Section 34(3). The court will examine whether the contractor's reasons for delay are valid and sufficient to warrant condonation, considering the principles established in cases like Union of India Vs. Tecco Trichy Engineers & Contractors, (2005) 4 SCC 239, and State of Maharashtra & Ors. Vs. ARK Builders Pvt. Ltd., (2011) 4 SCC 616.",
    "Relevant Sections": "**Section 34(3) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996:**\n\n(3) An application for setting aside may not be made after three months have elapsed from the date on which the party making that application had received the arbitral award or, if a request had been made under Section 33, from the date on which that request had been disposed of by the arbitral tribunal:\n\nProvided that if the Court is satisfied that the applicant was prevented by sufficient cause from making the application within the said period of three months it may entertain the application within a further period of thirty days, but not thereafter.",
    "Context": "This case involves a dispute arising from a construction contract in a rural area, where the contractor is seeking to set aside an arbitral award, challenging the time limit and the reasons for condonation of delay. The jurisdiction is likely to be the High Court or the Commercial Court, depending on the value of the dispute and the relevant state laws."

Principal Secretary, Irrigation Department & Ors., (2008) 7 SCC 169, to determine if the agency acted reasonably and provided fair opportunity to the construction company.",
