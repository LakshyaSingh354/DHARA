    "Query": "A contractor was awarded a contract by a government agency.  The contractor allegedly submitted fraudulent documents to secure the contract.  After the contract was awarded, the agency discovered the fraud and cancelled the contract.  The contractor sued the agency for breach of contract and demanded payment for work performed.  The agency argued that the contract was voidable due to the contractor's fraud.  The contractor then filed for arbitration.  The agency sought to have the arbitration award set aside, arguing that the arbitrator had no jurisdiction because the contract was void due to fraud.",
    "Legal Principles": "The legal principles involved in this case include the validity of contracts, the impact of fraud on contract formation, the right to arbitration, and the jurisdiction of arbitrators.  The Court will likely consider the following legal precedents:  (1)  Whether a contract obtained through fraud is void or voidable. (2)  Whether a void contract can be the subject of arbitration.  (3)  Whether an arbitrator's jurisdiction is limited to the terms of the contract or extends to issues of contract validity. ",
    "Relevant Sections": "The relevant sections of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, include Section 34(2), which allows a party to apply to set aside an arbitral award on grounds such as lack of jurisdiction.  The case may also refer to Section 11(5) of the Act, which governs the appointment of an arbitrator.",
    "Context": "This case involves a dispute between a government agency and a contractor, and the question of whether an arbitration award can be set aside on the grounds of the arbitrator's lack of jurisdiction.  The jurisdiction issue stems from the agency's claim that the contract was voidable due to fraud.  The case is heard in India, specifically in the Allahabad High Court."
