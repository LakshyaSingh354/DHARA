    "Query": "A mining services company (an LLP incorporated in India) has entered into a contract with an Indian company to provide mining services. A dispute arises, and the mining services company files an application under Section 9 of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996 (the Act) seeking an injunction against the Indian company from invoking a bank guarantee. The arbitration clause in the contract designates Singapore as the seat of arbitration. The Indian company objects to the maintainability of the application, arguing that the arbitration is not an 'international commercial arbitration' and therefore the High Court lacks jurisdiction. Does the High Court have jurisdiction to hear the application?",
    "Legal Principles": "The determination of whether an arbitration is an 'international commercial arbitration' is crucial for determining the jurisdiction of courts under the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996. The definition of 'international commercial arbitration' in Section 2(1)(f) of the Act hinges on the nationality of the parties, not the seat of arbitration. In the absence of a foreign party, the arbitration is considered domestic, and the application under Section 9 would lie with the Principal Civil Court.",
    "Relevant Sections": "Section 2(1)(e), Section 2(1)(f), Section 2(2), Section 9, Section 10(3) of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015",
    "Context": "Jurisdiction in arbitration matters under the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996, specifically in relation to applications under Section 9 seeking injunctions, is determined by the nature of the arbitration â€“ whether it is domestic or international. The seat of arbitration, while relevant for the nature of the award (domestic or foreign), does not determine the jurisdiction of the Court in the initial stages."

    "Query": "A construction company based in India has entered into a contract with a foreign company (incorporated outside India) to build a commercial complex. The contract includes an arbitration clause specifying London as the seat of arbitration. A dispute arises, and the Indian construction company approaches the High Court under Section 9 of the Act seeking an injunction to prevent the foreign company from invoking a performance bank guarantee. The foreign company objects, arguing that the Indian High Court lacks jurisdiction due to the seat of arbitration being in London. Does the High Court have jurisdiction?",
    "Legal Principles": "The presence of a foreign party (incorporated outside India) in an arbitration agreement automatically classifies it as an 'international commercial arbitration' under Section 2(1)(f) of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996, regardless of the seat of arbitration. In such cases, the High Court, in the exercise of its ordinary original civil jurisdiction, has jurisdiction to hear applications under Section 9.",
    "Relevant Sections": "Section 2(1)(e), Section 2(1)(f), Section 9",
    "Context": "The presence of a foreign party in an arbitration agreement is a crucial determinant of the nature of the arbitration and the subsequent jurisdiction of the courts under the Act. The Indian High Court, having jurisdiction over international commercial arbitrations, would have jurisdiction to hear the application."

The contract contains an arbitration clause designating the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) in Paris as the arbitral institution and specifying Paris as the seat of arbitration. A dispute arises, and the Indian company approaches the Delhi High Court under Section 9 of the Act seeking an injunction to restrain the foreign company from taking any action that could prejudice the arbitration.

    "Relevant Sections": "Section 2(1)(e), Section 2(1)(f), Section 9",
    "Context": "The presence of a foreign party is the key factor determining the nature of the arbitration and the subsequent jurisdiction of the courts under the Act.  Even though the seat of arbitration is in Paris, the Delhi High Court, being competent for international commercial arbitrations, has jurisdiction."

    "Query": "Two Indian companies have entered into a joint venture agreement. The agreement specifies that any disputes arising from the agreement will be settled by arbitration in Singapore under the rules of the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC). One of the companies approaches the Madras High Court under Section 9 of the Act seeking an injunction to restrain the other company from taking any action that could jeopardize the joint venture. The other company objects, claiming that the Madras High Court lacks jurisdiction because the seat of arbitration is in Singapore.  Does the Madras High Court have jurisdiction?",
    "Legal Principles": "The absence of a foreign party means the arbitration is not an 'international commercial arbitration'.  The Madras High Court, therefore, lacks jurisdiction. The jurisdiction lies with the Principal Civil Court or the designated Commercial Court in the district where the arbitration is to take place.",
    "Relevant Sections": "Section 2(1)(e), Section 2(1)(f), Section 9, Section 10(3) of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015",
    "Context": "The presence of a foreign party is the crucial factor determining the nature of the arbitration.  Because both parties are Indian companies, the arbitration is considered domestic. The Madras High Court, lacking jurisdiction over domestic arbitrations, would not be the appropriate forum."
