    "Query": "A construction company, 'ABC Builders', is challenging an arbitration award issued against them by the Commercial Court in Ranchi. They argue that the court should have considered their arguments regarding the validity of the arbitration agreement. Should the High Court intervene in this matter under Article 227?",

This jurisdiction can be exercised to ensure that subordinate courts act within their powers and that the principles of natural justice are followed. However, the High Court cannot act as an appellate court and should not interfere with the findings of fact by the subordinate court unless there is a manifest error or a gross failure of justice.",
