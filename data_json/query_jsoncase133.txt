    "Query": "A property buyer, Mr. Kumar, filed an application under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, challenging an arbitral award that ordered specific performance of a sale agreement. He argued that the agreement was not properly stamped and therefore invalid. The seller, Ms. Sharma, countered that the stamping issue was raised for the first time before the court and the agreement was valid. Can the court set aside the arbitral award based on the alleged stamping defect?",
    "Legal Principles": "Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, deals with applications to set aside arbitral awards. The court can set aside an award if it is satisfied that the award was made in contravention of the provisions of the Act, or that the award was against public policy. The court can also consider the issue of the validity of the underlying agreement, including the issue of proper stamping. However, the court cannot consider issues that were not raised before the arbitrator.",
