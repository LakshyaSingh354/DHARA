    "Query": "A construction contractor is disputing the appointment of an arbitrator chosen by the other party, arguing that the agreed-upon procedure for selecting an arbitrator was not followed. The contractor claims that the court did not properly appoint the arbitrator, despite the court's order indicating the parties should proceed with the arbitration. The contractor also argues that he participated in the arbitration proceedings without raising the objection, but he later raised the jurisdictional issue before the arbitrator. Can the contractor challenge the arbitrator's appointment and award based on procedural irregularities in the appointment process?",
    "Legal Principles": "Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, Sections 4, 11, 11(6), 16, 16(4), 34, 34(2A), 37; Appointment of Arbitrator; Agreed Procedure; Waiver of Objection; Jurisdiction of Arbitrator; Later Plea; Patent Illegality",
    "Relevant Sections": "Section 4: Waiver of right to object. --A party who knows that--\n(a) any provision of this Part from which the parties may derogate, or\n(b) any requirement under the arbitration agreement, has not been complied with and yet proceeds with the arbitration without stating his objection to such non-compliance without undue delay or, if a time limit is provided for stating that objection, within that period of time, shall be deemed to have waived his right to so object.\n\nSection 11(6):  If the parties fail to agree upon an arbitrator within thirty days of the receipt by one party of a request from the other party for the appointment of an arbitrator, any party to the arbitration agreement may apply to the designated court for the appointment of an arbitrator.\n\nSection 16(4): Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-sections (1) and (2), the arbitral tribunal may, if it considers it necessary for the proper administration of justice, admit a partyâ€™s statement of claim, defence or other pleading after the time fixed therefor by the arbitral tribunal.",
    "Context": "Jurisdiction of the arbitrator in a construction contract dispute, where the agreed-upon procedure for appointing an arbitrator was not followed. The case involves the interpretation of various sections of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, specifically related to the appointment, jurisdiction, and waiver of objections pertaining to an arbitrator."

    "Query": "A government agency awarded a construction contract to a company, but a dispute arose regarding the payment for additional work. The contractor argues that the agency's delay in approving the design caused an increase in costs, while the agency contends that the contractor is only entitled to the additional payment agreed upon in a supplementary agreement. The arbitrator awarded a significant sum to the contractor, including for idle men and machinery, loss of profits, and overheads. The agency challenges the award, arguing that it is excessive and not supported by evidence. How should the court evaluate the award in this case, considering the alleged lack of evidence and the potential for patent illegality?",
    "Legal Principles": "Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, Sections 34, 34(2A); Award of Arbitrator; Excessive Award; Lack of Evidence; Patent Illegality",
    "Relevant Sections": "Section 34(2A): An award may be set aside by the court on the ground that it is in conflict with the public policy of India, or it is patently illegal or is based on an error apparent on the face of the award.",
    "Context": "Challenge to an arbitral award in a construction contract dispute involving the calculation of compensation for additional work and alleged delay. The case involves the application of Section 34(2A) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, which allows for setting aside an award based on patent illegality."

    "Query": "A construction company and a government agency entered into a contract, and the contract contained a clause specifying the procedure for resolving disputes through arbitration. The clause required that any dispute be settled by a sole arbitrator appointed by agreement between the parties or, in the absence of agreement, by one of the named institutions listed in an annexure. The company invoked Section 11(6) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, to seek the appointment of a specific individual as the arbitrator, despite not approaching any of the named institutions. The court, in its order, did not explicitly appoint the individual as the arbitrator but instead instructed the parties to proceed with the arbitration. The company proceeded with the arbitration, but the agency later challenged the arbitrator's jurisdiction on the grounds that the agreed-upon procedure was not followed. Can the court consider the agency's challenge to the arbitrator's jurisdiction, even though the agency did not appeal the court's order?",
