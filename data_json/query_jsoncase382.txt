    "Query": "A landlord is seeking to evict a tenant for non-payment of rent. The lease agreement contains a clause stating that the tenant has a right to renew the lease for a further period of 'NIL' years. The tenant argues that this clause implies an automatic renewal for the same term as the original lease. The landlord argues that the 'NIL' years clause indicates that renewal is only possible with mutual agreement on the duration. How should the court interpret the 'NIL' years clause in the lease agreement?",
    "Legal Principles": "Interpretation of contracts, particularly ambiguous clauses, is guided by the principle of 'contra proferentem,' which holds that ambiguities are construed against the party who drafted the contract.  Courts also consider the intention of the parties, as evidenced by the surrounding circumstances and the overall context of the agreement. In this case, the interpretation should favor the tenant, as the landlord drafted the contract.",
    "Relevant Sections": "• Section 91, 92, and 94 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 (barring oral evidence to contradict or vary written contracts)\n• Order XII Rule 6 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (summary judgment based on admission of facts)",

    "Query": "A company has a lease agreement with a property owner. The agreement includes a clause that allows for renewal of the lease at the end of the term. However, the clause does not specify a renewal period. The company argues that the clause allows for an automatic renewal for the same period as the initial lease. The property owner argues that the lack of a specified period means the renewal requires mutual agreement. Can the company unilaterally renew the lease?",
    "Legal Principles": "Renewal clauses in lease agreements require clear and unambiguous terms.  If the clause is silent on the renewal period, it is generally interpreted as requiring mutual agreement between the parties for renewal.  This aligns with the principle that contracts should not create perpetual obligations without express consent.",

    "Query": "A construction company has a contract with a developer for the construction of a residential building. The contract includes a clause allowing for a 'NIL' year extension of the project completion date. The developer claims that this means the completion date can be extended indefinitely with mutual agreement. The construction company argues that the 'NIL' years clause implies an automatic extension for the original project duration. Which interpretation is correct?",
    "Legal Principles": "The interpretation of the 'NIL' year clause should prioritize the principle of 'contra proferentem' since the developer drafted the contract.  The court should also consider whether the 'NIL' year clause was intended to grant the developer unfettered discretion to extend the project timeline.",

    "Query": "A company is disputing a provision in a lease agreement that allows for renewal on 'mutually agreeable terms'. The company argues that the phrase is too vague and allows for arbitrary changes to the lease terms. The property owner argues that the clause provides flexibility for both parties. Is the 'mutually agreeable terms' clause enforceable?",
    "Legal Principles": "Contracts must be sufficiently certain to be enforceable. Vague and ambiguous terms, such as 'mutually agreeable terms', can make a contract unenforceable.  The court may consider whether the clause is so vague that it renders the contract meaningless or whether it allows for a reasonable interpretation of the parties' intentions.",
