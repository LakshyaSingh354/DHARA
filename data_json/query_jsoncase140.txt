    "Query": "A construction company filed a claim against a government agency for unpaid work. The agency raised a counterclaim arguing that the company had overcharged them for certain materials. The arbitrator dismissed the counterclaim, citing that it was not referred to him by the Appointing Authority as required by the contract. The agency wants to challenge the arbitrator's decision. Should the court set aside the award?",
    "Legal Principles": "The court should set aside an arbitral award if it finds that the award is contrary to the fundamental policy of Indian law, is against basic notions of justice or morality, or if there is patent illegality on the face of the award. This case involves the question of whether the arbitrator acted within his jurisdiction by dismissing the counterclaim without it being referred by the Appointing Authority.",
    "Relevant Sections": "Clause 25 of the GCC states that the Arbitrator shall adjudicate only on such disputes as are referred to him by the Appointing Authority. Section 11 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act requires the Chief Justice or his designate to either appoint the arbitrator/s or take necessary measures in accordance with the appointment procedure contained in the arbitration agreement. Section 14(2) of the Act allows the court to appoint an arbitrator when parties fail to concur in the appointment, or the authority named in the agreement fails to nominate the arbitrator.",
