    "Query": "A plaintiff filed a suit for recovery of money in 2015. The defendant applied for extension of time to file their written statements in 2018. The plaintiff argued that the suit was a regular suit and not a commercial dispute under the Commercial Courts Act, 2015. The court allowed the defendants' applications for extension of time. The plaintiff appealed against the order, arguing that the dispute was a commercial dispute and the court should have applied the provisions of the Commercial Courts Act. The appeal was dismissed as not maintainable. The plaintiff then filed a review application, arguing that the court had made an error in applying the law and that the suit was a commercial dispute. Should the court review its order?",
    "Legal Principles": "Review of a judgment is an exception to the principle of finality of judicial pronouncements.  The review jurisdiction is confined to the grounds mentioned in Order XLVII of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908.  A review is for an error that is apparent on the face of the record, one that is easily identified upon revisiting the order and not consequent to elaborate arguments. The error must be patent in character, a disregard of a settled proposition of law or a relevant statutory provision as it stood on the day of passing of the order.  A review is not a reconsideration of a case on merits undertaken for a fresh decision upon re-hearing of the matter.  A matter may be resisted and reopened to correct a substantial injustice which may have resulted from the decision.",

    "Legal Principles": "The review jurisdiction of a court is restricted and should not be exercised lightly.  It is not an appeal in disguise and should not be used to reconsider the case on merits.  A review is only available for errors that are apparent on the face of the record, and not for errors that require detailed scrutiny of evidence or legal arguments.",
