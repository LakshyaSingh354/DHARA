The defendant argues that the designs are invalid due to prior publication and has filed a counterclaim seeking cancellation of the registrations. Is the counterclaim maintainable under the Designs Act, 2000?",

Mold-Tek Packaging Ltd. clarified that defendants can independently file a counterclaim for cancellation within a piracy suit, and the court must transfer the suit to the High Court.",
    "Relevant Sections": "Section 19: Cancellation of registration - (1) Any person interested may present a petition for the cancellation of the registration of a design at any time after the registration of the design, to the Controller on any of the following grounds, namely: ...\n\nSection 22: Piracy of registered design - (3) In any suit or any other proceeding for relief under sub-section (2), every ground on which the registration of a design may be cancelled under Section 19 shall be available as a ground of defence. ...
