Can the court entertain Prime Properties' lawsuit, or should it refer the matter back to arbitration?",

    "Query": "Two businesses, Alpha Inc. and Beta Co., entered into a contract for the supply of goods. The contract includes an arbitration clause.  Alpha Inc. filed a lawsuit against Beta Co., claiming breach of contract and seeking damages, but also included a claim against a third party, Gamma Ltd., alleging that Gamma Ltd. interfered with the contract.  Beta Co. wants to refer the dispute to arbitration, but Alpha Inc. argues that the inclusion of Gamma Ltd. makes the entire dispute non-arbitrable. Should the court refer the dispute to arbitration?",
    "Legal Principles": "The court may analyze whether the claim against Gamma Ltd. is a separate and distinct issue that can be severed from the main dispute.  If the court finds that the claim against Gamma Ltd. is inherently intertwined with the contract dispute, it may deem the entire dispute non-arbitrable.",

    "Relevant Sections": "The Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (India) may contain provisions regarding the enforcement of foreign arbitration agreements.
