    "Query": "A state government entered into an agreement with a private company for construction work. The work was delayed due to protests by local residents demanding rehabilitation. The company sought arbitration, and the Arbitral Tribunal awarded them compensation. The state government, claiming it wasn't a party to the arbitration, filed a petition to set aside the award. The Commercial Court dismissed the petition, and the government now appeals. Can the state government appeal against the award after failing to participate in the arbitration process?",
