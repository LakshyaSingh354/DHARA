    "Query": "A plaintiff filed a suit for recovery of a sum of money against the defendant in a civil court. The suit was transferred to a Commercial Court after the establishment of Commercial Courts. The defendant did not file a written statement within the 120 days prescribed by the amended Civil Procedure Code. The defendant filed an application to set aside the ex-parte order passed against him and sought leave to file a written statement. The Commercial Court allowed the application. The plaintiff filed a revision petition challenging the order of the Commercial Court. Whether the Commercial Court has the jurisdiction to extend the time for filing a written statement beyond 120 days in a suit transferred from a civil court to a Commercial Court?",
    "Legal Principles": "The Commercial Courts Act, 2015, amended certain provisions of the Civil Procedure Code (CPC) to expedite the disposal of commercial disputes. The Act prescribes a maximum time limit of 120 days for filing a written statement in a commercial dispute. However, Section 15(4) of the Act allows the Commercial Court to prescribe a new time period for filing a written statement in a suit transferred from a civil court. The proviso to Section 15(4) states that the proviso to Order V Rule 1 of the CPC shall not apply to such transferred suit. This means that the restriction on filing a written statement within 120 days is not attracted to a pending civil suit transferred to the Commercial Court. However, the Commercial Court must prescribe a new time line for filing the written statement.",
