    "Query": "A contractor has furnished a performance bank guarantee for a construction project. The project was delayed, and the contract was terminated. The contractor claims that the termination was unjustified and seeks to restrain the employer from invoking the bank guarantee. What are the legal principles that govern this scenario?",
    "Legal Principles": "The bank guarantee is an independent contract between the bank and the beneficiary.  Courts are generally reluctant to interfere with the invocation of bank guarantees unless there is a clear case of fraud, irretrievable injustice, or special equities. The existence of a dispute between the beneficiary and the party at whose instance the bank guarantee was given is generally immaterial. ",
    "Relevant Sections": "Section 9(1), Section 9(3) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996; Section 126 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872; Order 39 Rules 1 & 2 of the CPC",
    "Context": "Jurisdiction: India; Case Type: Arbitration Appeal; Subject Matter: Performance Bank Guarantee, Contract Termination, Interim Injunction"

The company argues that the government's actions constitute a breach of contract. Is the company likely to succeed in obtaining an injunction against the invocation of the bank guarantee?",
    "Legal Principles": "The bank guarantee is an independent contract between the bank and the beneficiary.

A court may grant an injunction against the invocation of a bank guarantee only in exceptional circumstances, such as a clear case of fraud or irretrievable injustice. ",
