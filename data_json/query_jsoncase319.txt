    "Query": "A company, ABC Corporation, is seeking to enforce an arbitration award against a foreign entity, DEF Ltd. The award was issued by a foreign arbitration body under the rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL). ABC Corporation filed an execution petition in the Commercial Court, seeking to enforce the award against DEF Ltd. DEF Ltd. argues that the Commercial Court does not have jurisdiction to enforce a foreign arbitration award and that the matter should be brought before the Commercial Division of the High Court.

The Commercial Division of the High Court generally has jurisdiction over international arbitration matters, including the enforcement of foreign awards. The Supreme Court's decision in Kandla Export Corporation & Anr. v. OCI Corporation & Anr. (2018 SCC OnLine SC 170) provides important guidance on the scope of appeals under Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act.",

    "Query": "A dispute arises between two Indian companies, XYZ Ltd. and PQR Ltd., concerning a construction contract. The contract contains an arbitration clause specifying arbitration in India under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, with the arbitration to be conducted in English. The sole arbitrator appointed by the parties issued an award in favor of XYZ Ltd. PQR Ltd. refuses to comply with the award and XYZ Ltd. files an execution petition in the Commercial Court.

What is the relevant law and precedent regarding the jurisdiction of a Commercial Court to enforce domestic arbitration awards?",

The Commercial Courts Act, 2015, provides for jurisdiction over such cases, while international commercial arbitration matters are typically within the purview of the Commercial Division of the High Court. The case of M/s.OCI Corporation v. Kandla Export Corporation & Ors.

    "Query": "A company, DEF Ltd., is seeking to enforce an arbitration award against a foreign entity, GHI Corp. The award was issued by a foreign arbitration body under the rules of the London Court of International Arbitration (LCIA). DEF Ltd. filed an execution petition in the Commercial Court. GHI Corp. objects to the jurisdiction of the Commercial Court, arguing that the Commercial Division of the High Court has exclusive jurisdiction over international arbitration matters.

However, the decision in M/s.OCI Corporation v. Kandla Export Corporation & Ors.
