    "Query": "A construction company, 'ABC Builders', has been awarded a contract by 'XYZ Infrastructure' for a large-scale infrastructure project.  Due to delays in material delivery and site preparation by XYZ Infrastructure, ABC Builders suffered financial losses and project delays.  XYZ Infrastructure is now demanding a refund of advance payments made to ABC Builders and threatening to encash a bank guarantee provided by ABC Builders. ABC Builders has filed an application under Section 9 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, seeking interim protection against the encashment of the bank guarantee.  The Commercial Court, while rejecting ABC Builders' application for ex parte injunction, has ordered notice to XYZ Infrastructure. ABC Builders has now approached the High Court through a writ petition, seeking to quash the Commercial Court's order and grant an injunction against the encashment of the bank guarantee. Can the High Court intervene in this matter, and under what circumstances would an injunction against the encashment of a bank guarantee be permissible?",
    "Legal Principles": "The principle of 'special equities' or 'irretrievable harm or injustice' is a well-established exception to the general rule of non-intervention in the invocation of a bank guarantee. This principle allows the courts to restrain the enforcement of a bank guarantee in cases where fraud or egregious behavior on the part of the beneficiary is demonstrated, or when encashing the bank guarantee would result in irreparable damage or injustice to the party who provided the guarantee.",
    "Relevant Sections": "Section 9 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, deals with interim measures by the court during arbitration proceedings, including the grant of injunctions.\n\nOrder 39, Rule 3 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, mandates the court to direct notice to the opposite party before granting an injunction, except in exceptional circumstances. \n\nArticle 227 of the Constitution of India empowers the High Court to exercise its superintendence power over subordinate courts.",
    "Context": "Jurisdiction: High Court of Orissa. Case type: Writ Petition challenging an interlocutory order passed by the Commercial Court in a Section 9 application under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996."

    "Query": "In a case involving a contract for the supply of goods, 'Alpha Suppliers' has filed a Section 9 application in the Commercial Court, seeking an interim injunction to prevent 'Beta Industries' from terminating the contract due to alleged delays in delivery. The Commercial Court, without hearing Beta Industries, has granted an interim injunction in favour of Alpha Suppliers. Beta Industries has now filed an appeal against the Commercial Court's order, arguing that it is not maintainable under Section 37(1)(b) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, and that the Commercial Court had no authority to grant an ex parte injunction. What are the grounds for challenging an interlocutory order passed by the Commercial Court in a Section 9 application under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996?",
    "Legal Principles": "The appealability of interlocutory orders passed by the Commercial Court in a Section 9 application under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, is a complex issue that has been subject to differing interpretations by various High Courts. The prevailing view suggests that such orders are not appealable, but are challengeable through a writ petition under Article 227 of the Constitution of India.",
    "Relevant Sections": "Section 37(1)(b) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, deals with the appealability of orders passed by the Commercial Court in Section 9 proceedings. \n\nSection 8 of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, bars revision applications or petitions against interlocutory orders of the Commercial Court. \n\nSection 13 of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, provides for appeals from decrees of Commercial Courts, but subject to specific exceptions. \n\nOrder 43, Rule 1(r) of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, prescribes the appealability of certain orders, including orders under Order 39, Rule 3, relating to injunctions.",

Tech Solutions has now approached the High Court, challenging the Commercial Court's order. Can the High Court interfere with the Commercial Court's order, and under what circumstances can an injunction be granted against the encashment of a bank guarantee?",
    "Legal Principles": "The invocation of a bank guarantee is governed by principles of contractual interpretation and the specific terms of the guarantee. Courts generally refrain from interfering with the enforcement of unconditional bank guarantees, but exceptions exist in cases of fraud, irretrievable harm, or special equities. The burden of proving such exceptions rests on the party seeking to restrain the invocation.",

Delta Distributors has now filed an application before the High Court, seeking to vacate the interim injunction granted by the Commercial Court. Can the High Court vacate the interim injunction granted by the Commercial Court, and what factors should it consider while deciding this application?",
    "Legal Principles": "The principles governing the invocation of bank guarantees are based on the concept of their independence from the underlying contract. The beneficiary (Delta Distributors) is generally entitled to invoke the bank guarantee upon the occurrence of the stipulated event (non-delivery of goods), irrespective of any disputes between the parties.  However, the courts may interfere with the invocation in exceptional circumstances, such as fraud, irretrievable harm, or special equities.",
