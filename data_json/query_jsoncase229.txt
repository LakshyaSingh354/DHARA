The learned court specifically held that the mark 'Rose' is common and cannot be monopolised, however, failed to give any reason how it felt that the two marks are deceptively similar. \n 38.3 It is a settled law that the mark has to be seen as a whole. The commonality in both marks are the words 'Rose' and 'Lollipop'. In fact, the mark used by the appellants contains four words, the first being 'UNICON', which is the house name of the appellant and admittedly the respondent has no objection for its use. The second word is 'SWEET', which only describe the quality of the product being sweet. The same is descriptive and, in any case, is not used in the mark of the respondent.
