    "Query": "A construction company, ABC Construction, has been awarded a contract to build a new school building. The contract includes a performance guarantee in the form of a bank guarantee. Due to unforeseen delays caused by the client, XYZ Educational Trust, ABC Construction is unable to complete the project on time. XYZ Educational Trust invokes the bank guarantee and seeks payment from the bank. ABC Construction argues that the delay was beyond their control and seeks to restrain the invocation of the bank guarantee. What are the legal principles and relevant sections that apply to this case, and what should the court consider when deciding whether to grant an injunction?",
    "Legal Principles": "A bank guarantee is an independent contract between the bank and the beneficiary. It is not qualified by the underlying transaction or the validity of the primary contract between the person at whose instance the bank guarantee was given and the beneficiary. (Ansal Engineering Projects Ltd. v. Tehri Hydro Development Corporation Ltd.). Courts will not interfere with the enforcement of a bank guarantee except in cases where fraud, special equities, or irretrievable injustice is prime facie made out. (Ansal Engineering Projects Ltd. v. Tehri Hydro Development Corporation Ltd.).",
    "Relevant Sections": "The relevant sections are Section 9(1)(ii) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, which enables a party to apply to a Court for interim measures with respect to matters specified in Clauses (a) to (e) thereunder. The court also considers the terms of the bank guarantee and the letter of invocation in deciding the fate of a prayed injunctive relief. (Continental Construction Ltd. v. Satluj Jal Vidyut Nigam Ltd.).",

    "Query": "A company, DEF Ltd., entered into a contract with a government agency, GHI, for the supply of solar panels.

GHI invoked the bank guarantee and sought payment from the bank. DEF Ltd. claimed that the production delays were beyond their control and requested an injunction to restrain the invocation of the bank guarantee. However, DEF Ltd.'s financial records revealed that they had been investing heavily in other ventures, suggesting a potential lack of financial commitment to the GHI project. Should the court consider DEF Ltd.'s financial situation when deciding whether to grant an injunction against the invocation of the bank guarantee?",
    "Legal Principles": "The court should consider the principle of 'special equities' which arises when allowing encashment of an unconditional bank guarantee would result in irretrievable harm or injustice to one of the parties.  (Gujarat Maritime Board v. L&T Infrastructure Development Projects Ltd.).",
    "Relevant Sections": "The court would consider Section 9(1)(ii) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, and the provisions of Order XI of the Code of Civil Procedure, which relates to disclosure, discovery, and inspection of documents, as amended by the Commercial Courts, Commercial Division and Commercial Appellate Division of High Courts Act, 2015.

    "Query": "Company PQR entered into a contract with a government agency, STU, for the supply of software. The contract included a performance guarantee secured by a bank guarantee. STU invoked the bank guarantee, alleging that PQR failed to deliver the software according to specifications. PQR, however, contends that the software was delivered on time and the defects were due to STU's incorrect implementation. They argue that STU's invocation of the bank guarantee is fraudulent because they knew the issues were not PQR's fault. What evidence should PQR provide to establish fraud, and what are the legal principles applicable in this situation?",
