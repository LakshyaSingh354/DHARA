    "Query": "A plaintiff, a non-banking finance company, seeks to execute an arbitration award against a borrower. The borrower argues that the Commercial Court lacks jurisdiction because the State Government hasn't specified a pecuniary value for the Court.  The plaintiff argues the  'specified value' for the Commercial Court should default to the minimum value established by the Central Government.  How does the Court decide if the Commercial Court has jurisdiction?",
    "Legal Principles": "The Court must interpret the provisions of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, specifically Sections 2(1)(i) and 3(1-A) as amended by Act 28 of 2018, to determine the jurisdictional threshold of the Commercial Court. The Court will consider the interplay of Central Government and State Government notification powers in setting 'specified value' for Commercial Courts.  ",
