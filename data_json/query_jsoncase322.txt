    "Query": "A foreign company, 'Global Shipping Inc.', is suing a local Indian company, 'Seaways Ltd.', for non-payment of bunker fuel supplied to a vessel. The foreign company claims a judgment from a court in Singapore in their favor, but 'Seaways Ltd.' argues that the judgment is not enforceable in India as it was obtained under duress. How do Indian courts approach the enforcement of foreign judgments?",
    "Legal Principles": "The enforcement of foreign judgments in India is governed by Section 13 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908.

These exceptions include judgments obtained under duress, fraud, or against natural justice. The burden of proof lies on the party challenging the foreign judgment to demonstrate that it falls under one of these exceptions.",
