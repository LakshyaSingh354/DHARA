    "Query": "A contractor is claiming liquidated damages from a client due to delays in construction. The client argues that the delays were caused by the contractor's failure to coordinate with subcontractors.  The contract contains a clause stating that the contractor is not liable for delays caused by subcontractors.  Can the client invoke a performance bond to cover the liquidated damages?",
    "Legal Principles": "Bank guarantees are independent contracts, separate from the underlying contract between the beneficiary and the guarantor. Courts are reluctant to interfere with the enforcement of bank guarantees, except in cases of fraud, irretrievable injustice, or invocation of the guarantee contrary to its terms. The burden of proving fraud or special equities rests on the party seeking to restrain the beneficiary from invoking the guarantee.",
    "Relevant Sections": "**Hindustan Construction Co. Ltd. v. State of Bihar** (1991 (4) SCC 230): A bank guarantee constitutes a separate, distinct and independent contract. This contract is between the Bank and the beneficiary. It is independent of the main contract between the person who has furnished the bank guarantee and the beneficiary.  \n**Tarapore & Co. v. Visakhapatnam Steel Plant** (1996) 5 SCC 34: A bank guarantee is not qualified by the underlying transaction, or the validity of the primary contract between the person at whose instance the bank guarantee was given and the beneficiary.

    "Relevant Sections": "**UCM (Investment) v. Royal Bank of India** (1996) 5 SCC 450:  The commercial purpose, for which the system of confirmed irrevocable documentary credit has been developed in international trade, is to give to the seller an assured right to be paid before he parts with the control of the goods, and that does not permit of any dispute with the buyer, as to the performance of the contract being used as a ground for non-payment or reduction or deferment of payment. \n**Singh Consultants and Engineers (P) Ltd. v. U.P. Cooperative Federation Ltd.** (1974) 2 SCC 231: Performance guarantees are virtually promissory notes payable on demand. So long as an honest demand is made, the banks are bound to pay. They will rarely, if ever, be in a position to know whether the demand is honest or not. At any rate they will not be able to prove it to be dishonest. So they will have to pay.",

The bank giving such a guarantee is bound to honour it as per its terms irrespective of any dispute raised by its customer. \n**Ansal Engineering Projects Ltd. v. Tehri Hydro Development Corporation Ltd** (1996) 10 SCC 46: Unless fraud or special equity exists, is pleaded and prime facie established by strong evidence as a triable issue, the beneficiary cannot be restrained from encashing the bank guarantee even if dispute between the beneficiary and the person at whose instance the bank guarantee was given by the Bank, had arisen in performance of the contract or execution of the Works undertaken in furtherance thereof.",

L&T Infrastructure Development Projects Ltd** (2016) 11 SCC 720:  The guarantee given by the Bank to the appellant contains only the condition that in case of breach by the lead promoter viz. the first respondent of the conditions of LoI, the appellant is free to invoke the bank guarantee and the Bank should honour it without any demur, merely on a demand from GMB (appellant) stating that the said lead promoter failed to perform the covenants. \n**Gangotri Enterprises Ltd. v. Union of India** (1999) 8 SCC 436:  The sum claimed by the respondent from the appellant did not relate to the contract for which the bank guarantee had been furnished, but it related to another contract for which no bank guarantee had been furnished; the sum claimed by the respondent was in the nature of damages which was not yet adjudicated in the arbitration proceedings; the sum claimed was neither a sum due in the present, nor a sum payable by the respondent; it was not an admitted sum.",
