    "Query": "A construction company, ABC Construction, entered into a contract with a government agency, DEF, to build a new highway. The contract included a bank guarantee for performance. ABC Construction failed to complete the project on time and DEF invoked the bank guarantee.

What are the legal principles and relevant sections that govern the enforcement of bank guarantees in construction contracts?",

    "Query": "A software company, XYZ Software, developed a custom software application for a client, PQR Corporation. The contract included a bank guarantee for the software's performance.

XYZ Software claims the bank guarantee should not be enforced due to the minor nature of the defects. What are the legal principles and relevant sections that apply to the enforcement of bank guarantees in software development contracts?",

Company B contends that the bank guarantee should be enforced without considering the reasons for the delay. Is the bank guarantee enforceable despite the unforeseen circumstances?",
