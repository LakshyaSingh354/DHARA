    "Query": "A construction company entered into a contract with the state government for the construction of a road. The company claims that it incurred additional expenses due to delays caused by the government. The government argues that the delays were caused by the company's own negligence. The arbitrator ruled in favor of the company, but the government has challenged the award, arguing that the arbitrator's decision is patently illegal. How does the court determine if an arbitral award is patently illegal and can it partially set aside an award?",
    "Legal Principles": "The court's power to set aside an arbitral award is limited to the grounds specified in Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.  The court can set aside an award if it is patently illegal, which refers to an illegality that goes to the root of the matter. The court can also partially set aside an award, if the problematic portion is severable and doesn't impact the rest of the award.",
    "Relevant Sections": "Section 34(2-A) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (as amended in 2015), provides for the setting aside of an arbitral award on the ground of patent illegality. The court can set aside an award in part, if the problematic portion is severable, as per Section 34(2)(a)(iii) of the Act. ",

    "Legal Principles": "The court's power to set aside an arbitral award is limited to the grounds specified in Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.

What are the legal principles governing the interpretation of contracts and the application of law by arbitrators?",
