    "Query": "A power purchase agreement between a company and the state government was terminated due to a disagreement regarding the pricing of electricity generated using an alternate fuel. The company filed a claim for unpaid invoices, which was referred to arbitration. The arbitral tribunal awarded a significant sum to the company, which was partially set aside by the High Court. The State government appealed the High Court's decision to the Supreme Court. Can you help me understand the Supreme Court's reasoning in this case and the legal principles involved in determining the validity of an arbitral award?",
    "Legal Principles": "The Supreme Court reiterated the limited scope of judicial interference in arbitral awards, emphasizing that courts should not act as appellate courts and re-appreciate evidence. The Court highlighted the concept of “patent illegality” and its application in challenging arbitral awards, clarifying that it refers to illegality apparent on the face of the award and not something that is culled out through extensive analysis. The Court also emphasized that the Arbitrator's view on the evidence should not be substituted unless it is completely perverse or implausible.",

    "Query": "A construction company entered into a contract with the state government for the construction of a public building. The contract contained a clause requiring the company to pay certain supervision charges. After the contract was terminated due to legislative changes, the construction company filed a claim for a refund of excess payments, including supervision charges. The arbitral tribunal granted the refund but ignored the supervision charges clause. The state government appealed the arbitral award to the Supreme Court. Should the Supreme Court uphold the arbitral award?",
    "Legal Principles": "The Supreme Court stressed that ignoring a binding term of the contract governing the parties constitutes patent illegality and justifies interference with an arbitral award. The Court emphasized that the arbitral tribunal must decide in accordance with the terms of the contract and consider the relevant contractual clauses, not override them.",

    "Query": "Two businesses entered into a contract for the sale of goods. A dispute arose regarding the quality of the goods, leading to arbitration.

The company initiated arbitration, and the arbitral tribunal ruled in favor of the company, awarding compensation for the delay. The government agency appealed the award to the High Court.

Can you explain the legal principles governing the application of legal principles in arbitral proceedings?",
    "Legal Principles": "The arbitral tribunal is expected to apply relevant legal principles in its decision-making process, but it does not have to explicitly state every legal principle it considers. The High Court can interfere with an arbitral award only if the arbitral tribunal's application of legal principles is demonstrably perverse or patently illegal, meaning the tribunal has ignored or misapplied a fundamental legal principle. The High Court cannot simply re-evaluate the legal principles and substitute its own application for that of the tribunal.",
