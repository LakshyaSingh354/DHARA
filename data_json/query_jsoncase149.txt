    "Query": "A dispute arises between two companies regarding the terms of a distribution franchise agreement. One company claims the other is not a party to the arbitration agreement, while the other claims the dispute must be settled through arbitration. The court must determine whether an arbitration agreement exists and who are the rightful parties.",
    "Legal Principles": "The court must determine if an arbitration agreement exists and who are the rightful parties to it. This involves examining the contract and interpreting its terms to determine if an agreement to arbitrate exists between the specific parties in question. The court must consider the intent of the parties as expressed in the agreement and the relevant legal principles governing arbitration.",
    "Relevant Sections": "The court examined Clause 17.2 of the Distribution Franchise Agreement (DFA), which outlines the dispute resolution mechanism. This clause defines 'either party', 'both the parties', and 'parties' but does not explicitly exclude SPML from the arbitration process. The court further analyzed the roles of SPML, BEDCPL, and SBPDCL in the agreement, considering their contractual obligations and the nature of their relationship.",
    "Context": "This query concerns a dispute between two companies in the context of a distribution franchise agreement. The court is asked to determine if an arbitration agreement exists and who are the rightful parties to it. This falls under the jurisdiction of contract law and the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996."

    "Query": "A company seeks to appoint an arbitrator under Section 11(6) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, claiming the other party failed to appoint its own arbitrator. However, the other party argues that a previous arbitration proceeding involving a related entity had already been initiated and that the application is therefore barred.",
    "Legal Principles": "The principle of "res judicata" prevents parties from relitigating issues that have already been decided in a previous judgment. The court must determine if the previous arbitration proceeding, involving a related entity, bars a subsequent application for appointment of an arbitrator under Section 11(6) of the Act. The court must consider the nature of the previous proceedings, the relationship between the entities involved, and the scope of the arbitration agreement.",
    "Relevant Sections": "Section 11(6) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, governs the appointment of arbitrators when the parties fail to agree on an appointment procedure. The court examined the application for appointment of an arbitrator and the arguments presented by both parties. It considered the nature and scope of the previous arbitration proceedings and whether the issues in dispute had already been addressed.",
    "Context": "This query concerns an application for appointment of an arbitrator under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. The court is tasked with determining if the previous arbitration proceeding involving a related entity bars the current application, thereby raising the issue of res judicata."

    "Query": "A company argues that the mandate of the arbitral tribunal terminated after the expiry of the 12-month period, despite an extension granted by the court. The company seeks to challenge the court's order granting the extension, arguing that the court lacked jurisdiction.",
    "Legal Principles": "The court's jurisdiction to extend the mandate of an arbitral tribunal under Section 29A of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, is subject to certain conditions. The court must determine if the court that granted the extension was the appropriate court and if the extension was granted for sufficient cause. The court must consider the specific provisions of Section 29A, including the definition of "court" and the grounds for extending the mandate.",
    "Relevant Sections": "The court examined Section 29A(4) and (6) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, which govern the extension and substitution of arbitrators. It considered the definition of "court" in Section 2(e) and the specific powers granted to the court under Section 29A. The court also analyzed the arguments presented by the company challenging the court's order granting the extension.",
    "Context": "This query concerns a company's challenge to a court order granting an extension to the mandate of an arbitral tribunal. The court is asked to determine if the court that granted the extension had jurisdiction and if the extension was proper under Section 29A of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996."

    "Query": "A company seeks to have a non-signatory party added to an arbitration proceeding, arguing that the non-signatory party is ultimately liable for the obligations of the signatory party under the contract. The court must determine if the non-signatory party can be added to the arbitration.",
    "Legal Principles": "The court must determine if a non-signatory party can be added to an arbitration proceeding. This involves examining the contract and determining if the non-signatory party is bound by the arbitration agreement through a legal doctrine like "agency," "estoppel," or "piercing the corporate veil." The court must consider the relationship between the signatory and non-signatory parties, their obligations under the contract, and the nature of the dispute.",
    "Relevant Sections": "The court reviewed the Distribution Franchise Agreement (DFA) and the clauses relating to the obligations of SPML and BEDCPL. It considered the undertaking by SPML in Clause G to discharge the obligations of BEDCPL in the event of failure. The court also analyzed the concept of "agency" and its applicability to the relationship between SPML and BEDCPL.",
    "Context": "This query concerns a request to add a non-signatory party to an arbitration proceeding. The court is asked to determine if the non-signatory party can be added to the proceeding based on its relationship with the signatory party and the contract's terms."

    "Query": "A company argues that a previous arbitration proceeding involving a related entity has concluded, and therefore, a new arbitration proceeding involving the company itself is not permissible under the doctrine of res judicata.

The court also considered the principle of res judicata and its applicability to the case.",
