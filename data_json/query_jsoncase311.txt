    "Query": "A hotel owner, Mr. Smith, has entered into a leave and license agreement with a company, 'Star Hotels', to operate a hotel on his property. After the agreement expired, 'Star Hotels' refused to vacate the premises and continued to operate the hotel.  Mr. Smith filed a suit seeking possession of the property and recovery of unpaid license fees. 'Star Hotels' argued that the dispute should be resolved under the Rent Control Act, as the agreement was essentially a lease agreement.  Is the dispute governed by the Rent Control Act, or does the Commercial Courts Act apply?  What relief is Mr. Smith entitled to?",
    "Legal Principles": "The applicability of the Rent Control Act depends on the nature of the agreement and whether it satisfies the definition of a 'lease' under the Act. If the agreement is considered a lease and the company's share capital exceeds the prescribed threshold, the Rent Control Act may not apply. The Commercial Courts Act governs commercial disputes, including those arising from leave and license agreements, and provides jurisdiction for resolving such disputes.  The court will consider the terms of the agreement, the parties' intent, and other relevant factors to determine the appropriate jurisdiction.",
    "Relevant Sections": "Section 3 of the Maharashtra Rent Control Act, 1999 (relating to the applicability of the Act to companies with share capital exceeding Rs. 1 Crore). Section 2 (c) (i) & (vii) of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 (defining 'commercial dispute').",
    "Context": "Jurisdictional dispute between a property owner and a company operating a hotel on the property, involving a leave and license agreement and potential application of Rent Control Act or Commercial Courts Act."

    "Query": "A software company, 'Tech Solutions', entered into a contract with a manufacturing company, 'Industrial Gears', to develop a customized software system.  After the software was delivered, 'Industrial Gears' claimed that the software was defective and refused to pay the full contract price. 'Tech Solutions' filed a suit for payment, and 'Industrial Gears' counterclaimed for damages due to the alleged defects.  'Tech Solutions' argued that the dispute should be referred to pre-institution mediation before proceeding to trial. Is pre-institution mediation mandatory in this case?",
    "Legal Principles": "Section 12-A of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, mandates pre-institution mediation for commercial disputes that do not involve urgent interim relief.

    "Query": "Two construction companies, 'Buildco' and 'Constrx', entered into a contract for 'Buildco' to construct a commercial building for 'Constrx'.  After completion of the construction, 'Constrx' alleged that 'Buildco' had failed to comply with the contract specifications and refused to make full payment. 'Buildco' filed a suit for payment, and 'Constrx' counterclaimed for damages due to the alleged defects. 'Constrx' sought an interim injunction to restrain 'Buildco' from further using the building until the dispute was resolved. Is an interim injunction appropriate in this case, considering the construction project is complete and the building is operational?",
    "Legal Principles": "An interim injunction is a temporary order granted by the court to maintain the status quo pending the final determination of the suit.  The court will consider the balance of convenience and the likelihood of success on the merits before granting an injunction.  In cases where the project is complete and operational, the court may be hesitant to grant an injunction unless there is a clear risk of irreparable harm.",

After the lease period expired, 'Fashion Mart' refused to vacate the premises, claiming that they had a right to renew the lease under the terms of the lease agreement. Mr. Jones filed a suit for eviction, seeking to recover possession of the property. 'Fashion Mart' argued that they were entitled to an extension of the lease period based on their long-standing occupation and investment in the property.  Is Mr. Jones entitled to an eviction order, or does 'Fashion Mart' have a valid claim for an extension of the lease period?",
    "Legal Principles": "The right to renewal of a lease is governed by the terms of the lease agreement and applicable law. The court will consider whether the lease agreement expressly grants a right to renewal and whether the tenant has satisfied the conditions for renewal.

'IndusCorp' filed a suit for damages, seeking compensation for the losses incurred due to the delay. 'RawMat' argued that the delay was caused by unforeseen circumstances beyond their control.  Is 'RawMat' liable for damages for breach of contract, or can they rely on the doctrine of frustration to avoid liability?",
    "Legal Principles": "The doctrine of frustration applies when an unforeseen event occurs after the contract is made, rendering the performance of the contract impossible or fundamentally different from what was originally agreed upon.  The court will consider whether the event was unforeseeable, whether it rendered performance impossible or radically different, and whether the event was not the fault of either party.  If frustration is established, the contract is discharged, and neither party is liable for breach.",

After the novel was published, 'BookWorld' alleged that the novel contained defamatory content and refused to continue promoting it.

'FinanceCo' filed a suit for damages, alleging that 'CodeTech' had failed to meet the agreed security standards.  'CodeTech' argued that they had complied with the contract terms and that the security breaches were caused by external factors beyond their control.  Is 'CodeTech' liable for damages for breach of contract, or can they rely on the 'force majeure' clause to avoid liability?",
    "Legal Principles": "Force majeure clauses in contracts excuse performance when unforeseen events beyond the control of the parties occur, preventing or hindering performance.  The court will consider whether the event was unforeseeable, whether it prevented or significantly hindered performance, and whether the event was not the fault of either party.
