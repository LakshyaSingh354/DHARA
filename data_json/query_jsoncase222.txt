    "Query": "A judgment debtor is challenging the territorial jurisdiction of a Court executing a foreign decree against him personally. He argues that he is a resident of Kolkata and has never changed his residence. The executing Court is in Jamnagar, where the judgment debtor owns immovable property. Can the executing Court in Jamnagar exercise jurisdiction over the judgment debtor personally?",
    "Legal Principles": "Territorial jurisdiction in execution proceedings is governed by Section 39 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908.  The Court which passed a decree may send it for execution to another Court of competent jurisdiction if the person against whom the decree is passed actually and voluntarily resides, carries on business, or personally works for gain, within the local limits of jurisdiction of such other Court. However, nothing in this section shall be deemed to authorise the Court which passed a decree to execute such decree against any person or property outside the local limits of its jurisdiction. The doctrine of waiver/latches applies, requiring objections to territorial jurisdiction to be raised at the earliest possible opportunity. A failure to do so may result in the objection being barred.",
    "Relevant Sections": "Section 39 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908; Sections 21(1) and 21(3) of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908.",
    "Context": "This query concerns the territorial jurisdiction of a Court executing a foreign decree against a judgment debtor personally. The judgment debtor is challenging the Court's jurisdiction based on his residence outside the Court's jurisdiction. The Court's jurisdiction is based on the judgment debtor's ownership of immovable property within the Court's jurisdiction."

    "Query": "A judgment debtor is facing execution proceedings for a money decree passed by a foreign court. He has filed several applications challenging the jurisdiction of the executing Court, raising various grounds, and has been unsuccessful in his appeals. Can the judgment debtor raise the same jurisdictional challenge again in a subsequent application, or is he barred by principles of res judicata?",
    "Legal Principles": "Res judicata operates to prevent relitigation of issues that have already been decided by a competent court. The doctrine of constructive res judicata applies where an issue of law is decided in a previous proceeding, and the same issue arises in a subsequent proceeding between the same parties, even if the cause of action is different. However, this doctrine does not apply when the decision relates to the jurisdiction of the Court to try the earlier proceedings.",
    "Relevant Sections": "Section 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908.",
    "Context": "This query concerns the applicability of res judicata in execution proceedings. The judgment debtor is challenging the executing Court's jurisdiction based on grounds previously rejected by courts. The question is whether the judgment debtor can raise the same jurisdictional challenge again."

  {
    "Query": "A decree holder has sought to execute a money decree by attaching the judgment debtor's immovable property located within the executing Court's jurisdiction. The judgment debtor, however, argues that he is a resident of Kolkata and that the decree should be transferred to a Court in Kolkata for execution against his person. Does the executing Court have jurisdiction to proceed with the execution of the decree against the judgment debtor's property in Jamnagar?",
    "Legal Principles": "The executing Court has jurisdiction to execute a decree against property located within its jurisdiction, even if the judgment debtor resides outside its jurisdiction. The decree holder has the right to choose any mode of execution subject to the rules and provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908.",
    "Relevant Sections": "Section 39 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908; Order XXI of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908; Section 51 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908.",
    "Context": "This query concerns the jurisdiction of an executing Court to proceed with execution against property located within its jurisdiction, even if the judgment debtor resides outside its jurisdiction. The decree holder is seeking to execute the decree against the judgment debtor's property, while the judgment debtor is arguing for the transfer of the decree to his place of residence."
  },
  {
    "Query": "A decree holder has filed an application seeking to examine the judgment debtor under Order XXI Rule 41 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, to inquire about his assets and means of satisfying the decree. The judgment debtor claims that he was not given an opportunity to file a reply to the application and that the order was passed in violation of principles of natural justice. Does this ground justify challenging the order?",
    "Legal Principles": "Principles of natural justice require a fair hearing before a decision affecting a party's rights is made.  However, the principles of natural justice are not applicable in all cases, and their application depends on the nature of the proceedings. Order XXI Rule 41 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, is procedural, and the judgment debtor is not entitled to a hearing before the Court grants the decree holder leave to examine him.",
    "Relevant Sections": "Order XXI Rule 41 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908.",
    "Context": "This query concerns the applicability of principles of natural justice in the context of an application filed under Order XXI Rule 41 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, seeking examination of the judgment debtor. The judgment debtor is challenging the order based on a claim of violation of principles of natural justice."

  {
    "Query": "A judgment debtor has been directed to furnish a bank guarantee as security for his presence before the executing Court. He has failed to comply with this order. The decree holder has argued that the judgment debtor's actions demonstrate his scant regard for court orders and that his repeated challenges to the Court's jurisdiction are dilatory tactics intended to avoid execution of the decree. Is the judgment debtor's conduct relevant to the Court's decision on his jurisdictional challenge?",
    "Legal Principles": "The conduct of a party, including their failure to comply with court orders, can be relevant to the Court's decision on jurisdictional challenges.  If a party's actions are indicative of an intent to delay or obstruct the execution proceedings, the Court may take this into account when determining whether to entertain the party's challenge."
    "Relevant Sections": "Order XXI Rule 40(2) of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908.",
    "Context": "This query concerns the relevance of a judgment debtor's conduct in execution proceedings, including his failure to comply with court orders and his repeated challenges to the Court's jurisdiction. The decree holder argues that the judgment debtor's conduct is dilatory and intended to avoid execution."

  {
    "Query": "A judgment debtor has filed multiple applications challenging the jurisdiction of the executing Court, raising the same grounds repeatedly. The executing Court has rejected these applications, and the judgment debtor has appealed these decisions, only to be unsuccessful. Despite these decisions, the judgment debtor continues to raise the same jurisdictional challenges. Can the Court consider these repeated challenges as an abuse of the process of law?",
    "Legal Principles": "Repeated litigation on the same grounds, without new evidence or arguments, can be considered an abuse of the process of law. Courts have the inherent power to prevent abuse of their process by parties."
    "Relevant Sections": "Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908.",
    "Context": "This query concerns the potential abuse of the process of law by a judgment debtor who repeatedly raises the same jurisdictional challenges despite previous rulings against him. The question is whether the Court can consider these repeated challenges as an abuse of process."

  {
    "Query": "A judgment debtor is challenging the territorial jurisdiction of a Court executing a foreign decree against him. He argues that he is a resident of Kolkata and that the decree should be executed by a Court in Kolkata. The decree holder, however, argues that the judgment debtor is actually residing in Ahmedabad and that the executing Court has jurisdiction based on the judgment debtor's presence in Ahmedabad. Can the executing Court determine the judgment debtor's residence for jurisdictional purposes?",
    "Legal Principles": "The executing Court has the authority to determine the residence of a judgment debtor for jurisdictional purposes based on evidence presented. However, the Court's findings must be based on sound judicial reasoning and cannot be based solely on speculation or assumptions."
    "Relevant Sections": "Section 39 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908.",
    "Context": "This query concerns the executing Court's authority to determine the residence of a judgment debtor for jurisdictional purposes. The judgment debtor is challenging the Court's jurisdiction based on his residence outside the Court's jurisdiction, while the decree holder argues that the judgment debtor is actually residing within the Court's jurisdiction."
  },
  {
    "Query": "A judgment debtor has filed an application challenging the territorial jurisdiction of the executing Court. The decree holder argues that the judgment debtor is barred from raising this objection because he failed to raise it at the earliest possible opportunity when the execution proceedings were filed. The judgment debtor contends that he only raised the objection when the decree holder sought to execute the decree against him personally. Does the judgment debtor's delayed objection preclude his challenge?",
    "Legal Principles": "Objections to the territorial jurisdiction of a court must be raised at the earliest possible opportunity.  A failure to do so may result in the objection being barred by the doctrine of waiver/latches. The judgment debtor's delayed objection may be considered a waiver of his right to challenge the jurisdiction."
    "Relevant Sections": "Sections 21(1) and 21(3) of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908.",
    "Context": "This query concerns the consequences of a judgment debtor's delayed objection to the territorial jurisdiction of an executing Court. The decree holder argues that the objection is barred by waiver/latches, while the judgment debtor argues that he raised the objection at the first opportunity when personal execution was sought."

  {
    "Query": "A judgment debtor is challenging an order directing him to be examined under Order XXI Rule 41 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, arguing that the executing Court lacks jurisdiction because he is not a resident of Jamnagar. The decree holder contends that the executing Court has jurisdiction to examine the judgment debtor based on the judgment debtor's ownership of immovable property in Jamnagar. Does the Court's jurisdiction to examine the judgment debtor extend beyond its jurisdiction to execute the decree?",
    "Legal Principles": "The Court's jurisdiction to examine a judgment debtor under Order XXI Rule 41 is distinct from its jurisdiction to execute the decree.  The Court has jurisdiction to examine the judgment debtor within its territorial jurisdiction, even if the decree is not being executed against the judgment debtor personally."
    "Relevant Sections": "Order XXI Rule 41 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908; Section 39 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908.",
    "Context": "This query concerns the territorial jurisdiction of an executing Court to examine a judgment debtor under Order XXI Rule 41 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, in the context of the judgment debtor's residence outside the Court's jurisdiction."

  {
    "Query": "A judgment debtor is challenging an order passed by an executing Court declaring him as 'absconding' for failing to disclose his current address. The judgment debtor argues that there is no provision in the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, to declare a person as 'absconding' in execution proceedings. Can the executing Court refer to the judgment debtor as 'absconding' for jurisdictional purposes?",
    "Legal Principles": "While the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, does not explicitly define 'absconding' in the context of execution proceedings, the term can be used to describe a judgment debtor who evades service of process or avoids appearing before the Court. This finding, however, should be based on evidence and not mere speculation."
    "Relevant Sections": "Order XXI Rule 37 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908.",
    "Context": "This query concerns the use of the term 'absconding' by an executing Court in the context of a judgment debtor who fails to disclose his current address. The judgment debtor challenges the Court's use of the term, arguing that it is not a recognized legal term in execution proceedings."
