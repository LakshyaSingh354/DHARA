    "Query": "A company, 'XYZ Corp', filed a suit against 'ABC Inc' in the Bombay High Court for breach of contract.

    "Relevant Sections": "Section 9-A of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908; Section 13 of the Commercial Courts, Commercial Division and Commercial Appellate Division of High Courts Act, 2015 (Act 4 of 2016); Order XLIII of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908.",
