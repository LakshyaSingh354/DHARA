    "Query": "A construction company, 'BuildRight', was contracted by a government agency to construct a new public library. BuildRight appointed a subcontractor, 'Concrete Solutions', to handle the concrete work.  During construction, BuildRight encountered delays and alleged that Concrete Solutions was responsible.  Concrete Solutions claimed that BuildRight's actions caused the delays and refused to pay for withheld amounts.  Concrete Solutions initiated arbitration, and BuildRight appointed its CEO as the sole arbitrator. Concrete Solutions protested this appointment, claiming bias, and the CEO resigned after facing complaints. BuildRight then appointed another individual associated with the company as arbitrator.  Concrete Solutions again objected and filed an application to challenge the arbitrator's appointment.  The court is now tasked with deciding if the appointment of the second arbitrator was valid, and whether the court can intervene to substitute another arbitrator.",
