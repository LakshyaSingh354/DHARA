    "Query": "A plaintiff filed a suit in a civil court seeking recovery of a sum of money. However, the defendant argues that the dispute is commercial in nature and should have been filed in a Commercial Court. The plaintiff claims that the suit was filed before the Commercial Courts Act came into effect and therefore the civil court has jurisdiction. What is the applicable law and procedure for determining jurisdiction in such cases?",
    "Legal Principles": "The Commercial Courts Act, 2015 provides for a specialized court system for commercial disputes of a specified value. The Act sets out specific requirements for filing suits in Commercial Courts, including the filing of a Statement of Truth and pre-institution mediation. The Act also amends certain provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure (CPC) in relation to commercial disputes. However, the Act does not explicitly exclude the application of Section 24 of the CPC, which deals with the power of transfer of suits between courts. The applicability of Section 24 of the CPC to suits involving commercial disputes of a specified value must be determined by considering the scheme and provisions of the Commercial Courts Act. The Supreme Court has held in Ambalal Sarabhai Enterprises Ltd. v. K.S. Infraspace LLP & Anr. (2020) 15 SCC 585 that if a suit is filed in a court that is not the appropriate court, the plaint may be returned to the plaintiff to be presented before the court of competent jurisdiction under Order VII Rule 10 of the CPC.",

    "Query": "A defendant filed an application under Order VII Rule 11 of the CPC seeking to reject the plaintiff's plaint in a commercial suit, arguing that the plaintiff failed to comply with the mandatory pre-institution mediation requirement under Section 12A of the Commercial Courts Act. The Commercial Court dismissed the application. The defendant now seeks to appeal this order. What are the grounds for appeal in this case?",
    "Legal Principles": "Section 12A of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 mandates pre-institution mediation in all commercial disputes of a specified value. Failure to comply with this requirement can be a ground for rejection of the plaint under Order VII Rule 11 of the CPC.  The appellate court can consider the grounds for appeal, including whether the Commercial Court erred in interpreting and applying Section 12A of the Act and whether the defendant's application under Order VII Rule 11 of the CPC was correctly dismissed.

    "Legal Principles": "The Commercial Courts Act, 2015 provides for the exclusive jurisdiction of Commercial Courts for commercial disputes of a specified value. The Act defines what constitutes a commercial dispute and specifies the value threshold. If a suit falls within the definition of a commercial dispute and meets the value requirement, the Commercial Court has exclusive jurisdiction.  The appellate court will consider whether the Commercial Court erred in determining whether the suit constituted a commercial dispute and whether it met the value threshold. ",
