    "Query": "A construction company, 'BuildRight Inc.', is facing financial difficulties and has several outstanding payments to subcontractors. One subcontractor, 'Concrete Solutions LLC', has filed an application under Section 9 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 seeking a bank guarantee to secure its claim. BuildRight Inc. argues that Concrete Solutions LLC is trying to gain priority over other creditors and that their financial distress does not warrant such an order.  I need to determine the legal basis for granting a bank guarantee in this scenario, considering the financial position of the main contractor.",
    "Legal Principles": "The court must assess whether there is a strong prima facie case for the subcontractor's claim, the balance of convenience, and the possibility of diminution of assets by the main contractor. The court should not grant relief merely on the technicality of the absence of averments, but must consider the overall circumstances and potential prejudice to the subcontractor.",
