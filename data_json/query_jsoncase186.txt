    "Query": "A government agency contracted with a private company to set up Common Service Centers (CSCs) in a specific division. The company failed to complete the project on time and only set up 99% of the centers. The government agency withheld revenue support due to the incomplete project. The company filed for arbitration, and the arbitrator awarded revenue support to the company. The government agency is appealing the arbitral award.  What are the legal principles governing the government's right to withhold revenue support due to the company's failure to complete the project on time?",
    "Legal Principles": "The legal principles governing this scenario are the contractual obligations of both parties, the principles of breach of contract, and the consequences of such breach. The government agency has a right to withhold revenue support if the private company breaches the contract, specifically if they fail to complete the project within the agreed timeframe. The arbitrator's decision can be challenged on grounds of public policy or perversity if the decision appears to be unfair or against the fundamental principles of contract law.",
    "Relevant Sections": "Condition No.2.1(a) of the Master Service Agreement (MSA) stipulates the number of CSCs to be set up and the requirement for operational certification by the State Designated Agency (SDA). Clause 3.1(f) of the MSA states that the SCA would not be eligible for revenue support unless the CSCs are rolled out within the specified timeframe and are certified as operational by the SDA.",

    "Query": "A construction company entered into a contract with a government agency to construct a bridge. The construction company failed to complete the project on time, citing unforeseen circumstances and delays caused by the government agency. The government agency terminated the contract and forfeited the construction company's performance bond. The construction company filed for arbitration, arguing that the government agency was responsible for the delays and that the termination of the contract was unjustified. The arbitrator ruled in favor of the government agency. The construction company is appealing the arbitral award. How should the court approach the issue of the government agency's right to terminate the contract and forfeit the performance bond?",
    "Legal Principles": "The court must examine the contract to determine whether the government agency had the right to terminate the contract under the circumstances. The court must also determine if the government agency fulfilled its contractual obligations and if the construction company's failure to complete the project was due to unforeseen circumstances or the government agency's delays. Additionally, the court must examine the grounds for forfeiture of the performance bond, including whether it was a valid provision in the contract and whether the termination was justified.",
    "Relevant Sections": "This case likely relies on the Indian Contract Act, 1872, and the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. Specifically, the court would examine Sections 56 and 62 of the Contract Act, which deal with the frustration of contracts and the termination of contracts due to breach. The court would also examine Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, which governs the grounds for challenging an arbitral award.",
