    "Query": "A company, 'ABC Corp', is challenging an order made in an enforcement proceeding initiated by 'XYZ Inc', the decree holder.  The challenge pertains to an arbitral award that was previously upheld by a Commercial Court. ABC Corp argues that the Commercial Appellate Division should have jurisdiction to hear their appeal, citing Order XLIII Rule 1 of the CPC.  I need to determine if the appeal is maintainable, considering the limitations imposed by the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, and the recent Supreme Court decision in Kandla Export Corporation.",
    "Legal Principles": "The Commercial Courts Act, 2015 significantly restricts the appellate jurisdiction of the Commercial Appellate Division. This restriction applies to orders made in enforcement proceedings, particularly those concerning arbitral awards.
