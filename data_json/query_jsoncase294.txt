    "Query": "A software company entered into an agreement with a government agency to provide e-governance services. The agreement stipulated a specific rate per transaction for a fixed period. Disputes arose regarding the effective date of the agreement, the revision of rates, and the calculation of the number of transactions. The company filed for arbitration, and the arbitrator awarded compensation based on revised rates. The government agency challenged the award, arguing that the revised rates were not applicable retrospectively. Can the court modify the arbitrator's award on the grounds of erroneous application of law?",
    "Legal Principles": "The court's power under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, is limited to setting aside the award on specific grounds. The court cannot modify the award. This principle is based on the need to ensure minimal judicial interference in arbitration proceedings and to uphold the finality of arbitral awards. The court can only set aside the award if it finds that it is vitiated by patent illegality, fraud, corruption, or contravenes fundamental public policy.",
    "Relevant Sections": "Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996: \"An arbitral award may be set aside by the Court only if... (a) the party making the application establishes on the basis of the record of the arbitral tribunal that... (iv) the arbitral award deals with a dispute not contemplated by or not falling within the terms of the submission to arbitration, or it contains decisions on matters beyond the scope of the submission to arbitration...\"",

    "Query": "A construction company entered into a contract with a government agency for the construction of a public building. The contract stipulated a fixed price and a completion deadline. The construction company incurred delays due to unforeseen circumstances, and the agency terminated the contract. The company filed for arbitration, and the arbitrator awarded damages for the termination. The agency argued that the arbitrator erred in calculating the damages, claiming that the company should have mitigated its losses. Can the court set aside the arbitrator's award on the grounds of perversity?",
    "Legal Principles": "An award can be set aside on the ground of perversity if the arbitrator's decision is based on no evidence or has been arrived at by ignoring vital evidence. The court, however, cannot reappreciate the evidence and substitute its own view for that of the arbitrator. The court must find that the arbitrator's decision is demonstrably irrational or illogical.",
    "Relevant Sections": "Section 34(2A) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996: \"An arbitral award arising out of arbitrations other than international commercial arbitrations, may also be set aside by the Court, if the Court finds that the award is vitiated by patent illegality appearing on the face of the award: Provided that an award shall not be set aside merely on the ground of an erroneous application of the law or by reappreciation of evidence.\"",
