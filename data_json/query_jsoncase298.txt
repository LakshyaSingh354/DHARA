    "Query": "A company received an arbitral award on 15th July 2022, and they filed an application to set aside the award on 15th October 2022, citing a delay caused by the unavailability of a key witness.  The court dismissed the application, stating that the delay was excessive and not sufficiently explained. The company is now appealing the decision, arguing that the court should have exercised its discretion to condone the delay. Is the court's decision to dismiss the application for condoning delay legally sound? ",
    "Legal Principles": "The principle of condonation of delay, as applied under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996,  is governed by the principle of 'sufficient cause' and the  phrase 'but not thereafter' in Section 34(3) effectively excludes the application of Section 5 of the Limitation Act, barring condonation of delay beyond the 30-day extension period.",
    "Relevant Sections": "Section 34(3) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996: 'An application for setting aside may not be made after three months have elapsed from the date on which the party making that application had received the arbitral award or, if a request had been made under section 33, from the date on which that request had been disposed of by the arbitral tribunal: Provided that if the Court is satisfied that the applicant was prevented by sufficient cause from making the application within the said period of three months it may entertain the application with a further period of thirty days, but not thereafter.'",
    "Context": "This is a case involving an appeal challenging a lower court's decision to dismiss an application for condonation of delay in filing an appeal against an arbitral award under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. The case is likely being heard in the High Court of Gujarat or another jurisdictional High Court."
