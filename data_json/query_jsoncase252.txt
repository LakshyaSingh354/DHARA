    "Query": "A landlord filed a suit for possession, arrears of rent, and mesne profits against a tenant who defaulted on rent payments and refused to vacate the premises after the lease expired. The tenant argued that the suit should be transferred to a commercial court because the premises was used for commercial purposes. The trial court, after initially transferring the case to the commercial court, later returned the plaint to the plaintiff to be instituted afresh before the commercial court, citing a recent judgment that held that commercial suits filed as ordinary suits must be returned to be filed as commercial suits. The landlord appealed the order returning the plaint, arguing that the trial court had erred in reviewing its own previous order to transfer the case and that the suit had already been properly amended to conform to commercial suit requirements.  What is the correct legal framework for determining the jurisdiction of a commercial court in this scenario, and can the trial court properly review its own order in this case?",
    "Legal Principles": "The legal principles involved are the jurisdiction of commercial courts under the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, the power of a court to review its own orders, and the application of Order VII Rule 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure (CPC) regarding the return of plaints. The court needs to balance the principle of finality of judgments against the need to ensure proper jurisdiction.",
