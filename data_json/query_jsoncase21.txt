    "Query": "A defendant in a commercial suit failed to file a written statement within the stipulated 120 days. They have now filed a motion seeking condonation of delay, arguing that exceptional circumstances prevented them from filing on time. Can the court condone the delay and allow the written statement to be taken on record?",
    "Legal Principles": "The Commercial Courts Act, 2015 amended the Code of Civil Procedure (CPC) to establish mandatory timelines for filing written statements in commercial suits. The amended Order VIII Rule 1 of the CPC states that a defendant forfeits the right to file a written statement after 120 days from the service of the summons, and the court cannot take it on record.  The Apex Court in M/s SCG Contracts India Pvt. Ltd. Vs. K.S. Chamankar Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. & Ors. (supra) has explicitly reaffirmed this mandatory nature of the time limit.",
    "Relevant Sections": "Order VIII Rule 1 of the CPC (as amended by the Commercial Courts Act): \"Provided that where the defendant fails to file the written statement within the said period of thirty days, he shall be allowed to file the written statement on such other day, as may be specified by the Court, for reasons to be recorded in writing and on payment of such costs as the Court deems fit, but which shall not be later than one hundred twenty days from the date of service of summons and on expiry of one hundred twenty days from the date of service of summons, the defendant shall forfeit the right to file the written statement and the Court shall not allow the written statement to be taken on record.\"",
    "Context": "This query pertains to the interpretation of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 and its impact on the procedure for filing written statements in commercial suits before the Commercial Division of the Bombay High Court. The judge is considering a motion for condonation of delay in filing a written statement, having to balance the need for efficient justice with the statutory limitations imposed by the Act."

    "Query": "A plaintiff in a commercial suit filed a plaint without disclosing all documents in their power, possession, control, or custody.  The defendant has moved to dismiss the suit under Order VII Rule 11(d) of the CPC. Is the plaintiff’s failure to disclose all documents a bar to the suit?",
    "Legal Principles": "Order XI of the CPC, as amended by the Commercial Courts Act, outlines the procedures for disclosure and discovery of documents in commercial suits. Failure to disclose relevant documents is not an absolute bar to a suit. The court has discretion to grant leave to rely on undisclosed documents if the plaintiff establishes reasonable cause for non-disclosure.",
    "Relevant Sections": "Order XI, Rule 1 of the CPC (as amended by the Commercial Courts Act): \"(5) The plaintiff shall not be allowed to rely on documents, which were in the plaintiff's power, possession, control or custody and not disclosed along with plaint or within the extended period set out above, save and except by leave of Court and such leave shall be granted only upon the plaintiff establishing reasonable cause for non-disclosure along with the plaint.\"",
    "Context": "This query concerns the procedural aspects of document disclosure in commercial suits under the Commercial Courts Act. The judge is addressing an application to dismiss a suit based on the plaintiff’s alleged non-compliance with document disclosure requirements."

    "Query": "A defendant in a commercial suit filed a motion seeking an extension of time to file their written statement, citing the illness of their legal representative as the reason for delay. The court has already extended the time once, and the 120-day period has expired. Can the court exercise its discretion under Order VIII Rule 9 to further extend the time?",
    "Legal Principles": "While the Commercial Courts Act introduced mandatory timelines for filing written statements in commercial suits, the court retains discretionary powers under Order VIII Rule 9 to require a written statement or additional written statement from any party at any time. However, this discretion is limited by the 120-day time limit set by the amended Order VIII Rule 1, and the court cannot extend the time beyond that limit.",
    "Relevant Sections": "Order VIII Rule 9 of the CPC: \"No pleading subsequent to the written statement of a defendant other than by way of defence to a set-off or counter-claim shall be presented except by the leave of the Court and upon such terms as the Court thinks fit, but the Court may at any time require a written statement or additional written statement from any of the parties and fix a time for presenting the same.\"",
    "Context": "This query focuses on the court’s discretionary powers under Order VIII Rule 9, specifically in relation to extending the time to file a written statement in a commercial suit. The judge is considering the application for an extension of time, balancing the need for procedural fairness with the strict time limits mandated by the Commercial Courts Act."

    "Query": "A defendant in a commercial suit is seeking to rely on the Bombay High Court (Original Side) Rules, arguing that they allow for the condonation of delay beyond the 120-day limit imposed by the Commercial Courts Act. Is the Bombay High Court (Original Side) Rules applicable to commercial suits governed by the Commercial Courts Act?",
    "Legal Principles": "The Commercial Courts Act is a special statute that seeks to regulate the procedure for commercial suits in a specific manner.  While the Bombay High Court (Original Side) Rules are also special rules, the Commercial Courts Act has overriding effect in case of conflict. This principle is established in the decisions of the Apex Court in Solidaire India Ltd. v. Fairgrowth Financial Services Ltd. and in Iridium India Telecom Ltd vs Motorola INC.",
    "Relevant Sections": "Section 16(3) of the Commercial Courts Act: \"Where any provision of any Rule of the jurisdictional High Court or any amendment to the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, by the State Government is in conflict with the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, as amended by this Act, the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure as amended by this Act shall prevail.\"",
    "Context": "This query explores the application of the Bombay High Court (Original Side) Rules in light of the Commercial Courts Act. The judge is addressing an argument that the High Court rules take precedence over the Act, particularly regarding the condonation of delay in filing written statements."

    "Query": "A plaintiff in a commercial suit filed in the Bombay High Court’s Commercial Division seeks to rely on the provisions of Order XV-A of the CPC, arguing that it allows the court to call for additional pleadings beyond the 120-day limit for filing written statements. Does Order XV-A allow the court to circumvent the mandatory 120-day limit?",
    "Legal Principles": "Order XV-A of the CPC provides the court with powers to call for additional pleadings and directions to ensure the efficient disposal of a suit. However, this power cannot be used to contradict the specific time limits set for filing written statements under Order VIII Rule 1, as amended by the Commercial Courts Act.",
    "Relevant Sections": "Order XV-A of the CPC (as amended by the Commercial Courts Act): \"The Commercial Division and Commercial Court shall follow the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, as amended by this Act, in the trial of a suit in respect of a commercial dispute of a Specified Value.\"",
    "Context": "This query delves into the interaction between Order XV-A of the CPC and the specific time limits for filing written statements under Order VIII Rule 1. The judge is analyzing the plaintiff's argument that Order XV-A grants the court broader authority to require pleadings."

    "Query": "A defendant in a commercial suit failed to file their written statement within 120 days, but now argues that their illness prevented them from filing on time. The plaintiff is willing to accept the late filing of the written statement if the defendant pays costs. Can the court accept the written statement and impose costs?",
    "Legal Principles": "While parties can consent to the filing of a written statement beyond the statutory time limit, the court’s jurisdiction to accept a written statement cannot be conferred by consent. The court is bound by the mandatory provisions of the Commercial Courts Act, which explicitly bars the filing of a written statement after 120 days.",
    "Relevant Sections": "Order VIII Rule 1 of the CPC (as amended by the Commercial Courts Act): \"...and on expiry of one hundred twenty days from the date of service of summons, the defendant shall forfeit the right to file the written statement and the Court shall not allow the written statement to be taken on record.\"",
    "Context": "This query concerns the court’s power to accept a late-filed written statement, considering the consent of the parties. The judge is analyzing the legal limitations imposed by the Commercial Courts Act on the court’s power to exercise discretion in this situation."

  {
    "Query": "A defendant in a commercial suit filed in the Bombay High Court’s Commercial Division has entered appearance before receiving the summons. They argue that the 120-day period should commence from the date of their appearance, as per a previous notification issued by the court. Is the notification regarding the commencement of the time limit still valid in light of the Commercial Courts Act?",
    "Legal Principles": "The Commercial Courts Act has amended the CPC to establish a clear and uniform procedure for commercial suits. The Act specifically mandates that the 120-day period for filing a written statement commences from the date of service of the summons, regardless of the defendant’s prior appearance.",
    "Relevant Sections": "Order VIII Rule 1 of the CPC (as amended by the Commercial Courts Act): \"...but which shall not be later than one hundred twenty days from the date of service of summons...\"",
    "Context": "This query focuses on the commencement of the 120-day period for filing a written statement, considering the defendant’s argument that their appearance should trigger the time limit.

  {
    "Query": "A commercial suit was originally filed as a non-commercial suit, but was later transferred to the Commercial Division of the Bombay High Court. The defendant argues that the Commercial Courts Act does not apply to suits transferred from non-commercial divisions. Does the Commercial Courts Act apply retrospectively to transferred suits?",
    "Legal Principles": "The Commercial Courts Act seeks to establish a uniform procedure for all commercial suits. While the Act may not have been in effect when the suit was originally filed, the Act's provisions apply to all commercial suits, including those transferred from non-commercial divisions.",
    "Relevant Sections": "Section 16(1) of the Commercial Courts Act: \"The provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 shall, in their application to any suit in respect of a commercial dispute of a Specified Value, stand amended in the manner as specified in the Schedule.\"",
    "Context": "This query examines the application of the Commercial Courts Act to suits that were initially filed outside the Commercial Division but later transferred. The judge is assessing the defendant's argument that the Act does not apply retrospectively."

  {
    "Query": "The plaintiff in a commercial suit filed before the Commercial Division of the Bombay High Court has been dilatory in removing office objections and serving the summons. Should the court impose strict timelines on plaintiffs in commercial suits to ensure expeditious disposal of cases?",
    "Legal Principles": "The Commercial Courts Act aims to expedite the disposal of commercial disputes. To achieve this goal, the court should adopt measures that ensure timely action by both plaintiffs and defendants. The court can consider imposing strict timelines on plaintiffs to remove office objections and serve the summons within a specified period, failing which the suit could be dismissed.",
    "Relevant Sections": "Section 17 of the Commercial Courts Act: \"The statistical data regarding the number of suits, applications, appeals or writ petitions filed before the Commercial Court, Commercial Appellate Courts, Commercial Division, or Commercial Appellate Division, as the case may be, the pendency of such cases, the status of each case, and the number of cases disposed of, shall be maintained and updated every month by each Commercial Courts, Commercial Appellate Courts, Commercial Division, Commercial Appellate Division and shall be published on the website of the relevant High Court.\"",

    "Query": "A plaintiff in a commercial suit is seeking to dismiss the suit after the 120-day period for filing a written statement has passed.  The defendant argues that the plaintiff should be estopped from dismissing the suit because they have not objected to the defendant's delay in filing.  Should the court consider the doctrine of estoppel in this case?",
    "Legal Principles": "The doctrine of estoppel prevents a party from asserting a right or claim that is inconsistent with a previous position they have taken. However, the doctrine is generally not applicable to bar a plaintiff from dismissing a suit, as the plaintiff has a right to discontinue the suit at any stage. ",
    "Relevant Sections": "Order XXIII Rule 1 of the CPC: \"A suit may be withdrawn by the plaintiff at any time before the judgment is pronounced.\"",
    "Context": "This query relates to the doctrine of estoppel and its application in commercial suits. The judge is considering the defendant's argument that the plaintiff should be prevented from dismissing the suit due to their prior inaction."
