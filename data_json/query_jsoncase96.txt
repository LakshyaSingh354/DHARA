    "Query": "A defendant in a commercial suit failed to file a written statement within the 120-day time limit prescribed by the Commercial Courts Act, 2015. The defendant claims that they were actively trying to settle the dispute with the plaintiff and therefore did not file the statement within the time limit. The defendant now requests that the court allow them to file the written statement belatedly.  Should the court exercise its discretion to allow the late filing?",
    "Legal Principles": "The Commercial Courts Act, 2015 mandates that a defendant must file a written statement within 120 days of service of summons. This time limit is mandatory and cannot be extended. However, the court may have the power to condone delays in exceptional circumstances, such as when the defendant can demonstrate that they were actively pursuing settlement negotiations and were not deliberately delaying the proceedings.",
    "Relevant Sections": "Order VIII Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, as amended by the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, specifies a 120-day time limit for filing a written statement in commercial suits. The proviso to this rule clarifies that no extension beyond 120 days is permissible.  The court's power to condone delay is restricted by the specific provisions of the Act.",
    "Context": "This query pertains to the interpretation of the mandatory time limit for filing written statements under the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, and the court's discretion to condone delays in exceptional circumstances."

    "Query": "A plaintiff in a commercial suit has filed an application seeking rejection of the defendant's plaint under Order VII Rule 11 CPC.  The defendant has simultaneously filed an application seeking condonation of delay for filing a written statement beyond the 120-day limit.  Should the court prioritize the application for rejection of the plaint or the application for condonation of delay, considering the defendant's attempt to file both applications simultaneously?",
    "Legal Principles": "Order VII Rule 11 CPC provides for the rejection of a plaint on grounds of insufficiency or non-compliance with procedural requirements. The defendant's right to file a written statement is subject to the mandatory time limit under Order VIII Rule 1 of the CPC as amended by the Commercial Courts Act, 2015. The court must consider the sequence and timing of the applications to ensure procedural fairness.",
    "Relevant Sections": "Order VII Rule 11 CPC deals with the rejection of a plaint. Order VIII Rule 1 of the CPC as amended by the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, establishes the 120-day time limit for filing a written statement.",
    "Context": "This query concerns the procedural order and priority in handling applications for rejection of a plaint and for condonation of delay in filing a written statement under the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, especially when filed simultaneously by the defendant."

  {
    "Query": "A defendant in a commercial suit filed an application for rejection of the plaint under Order VII Rule 11 CPC after the 120-day time limit for filing a written statement had expired.  The defendant argues that they are not obliged to file a written statement until the application for rejection of the plaint is decided.  Is this a valid argument?",
    "Legal Principles": "The filing of an application for rejection of a plaint under Order VII Rule 11 CPC does not excuse a defendant from their obligation to file a written statement within the time limit prescribed by Order VIII Rule 1 of the CPC, as amended by the Commercial Courts Act, 2015.  Both actions are distinct and subject to different procedural timelines.",
    "Relevant Sections": "Order VII Rule 11 CPC pertains to the rejection of a plaint. Order VIII Rule 1 of the CPC as amended by the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, sets the 120-day time limit for filing a written statement.",
    "Context": "This query addresses the interplay between the time limit for filing a written statement and the filing of an application for rejection of the plaint under the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, and whether the defendant's argument for deferring a written statement is valid."

  {
    "Query": "A commercial dispute arises between a borrower and a bank. The borrower claims that the bank's actions led to the borrower's business losses and seeks damages. The bank argues that the borrower's claim is frivolous and vexatious, as they had initiated recovery proceedings under the SARFESI Act and taken symbolic possession of the borrower's assets.  Can the borrower's claim be dismissed as frivolous and vexatious?",
    "Legal Principles": "A claim can be dismissed as frivolous and vexatious if it is demonstrably baseless, without any reasonable foundation in law or fact.  The court must consider whether the borrower's claim has a genuine legal basis and whether there is a reasonable possibility of success.  The bank's actions under the SARFESI Act, while relevant, do not automatically render the borrower's claim frivolous.",
    "Relevant Sections": "The Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002 (SARFESI Act) governs the recovery of secured debts. The court must consider the specific grounds for the borrower's claim and the bank's actions under SARFESI to determine if the claim is frivolous.",
    "Context": "This query concerns the application of the doctrine of frivolous and vexatious litigation in a commercial dispute involving a borrower and a bank, considering the bank's actions under the SARFESI Act."

  {
    "Query": "A defendant in a commercial suit failed to file a written statement within the 120-day time limit due to the defendant's counsel's oversight. The defendant seeks to condone the delay, arguing that the oversight constitutes sufficient cause.  Can the court condone the delay based on this explanation?",
    "Legal Principles": "The court may condone delay in filing a written statement beyond the 120-day limit under the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, if the defendant demonstrates sufficient cause. However, mere oversight by counsel, without any other compelling circumstances, may not be considered sufficient cause. The court must consider the seriousness of the delay, the prejudice caused to the plaintiff, and the defendant's efforts to mitigate the delay.",
    "Relevant Sections": "Order VIII Rule 1 of the CPC as amended by the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, mandates a 120-day time limit for filing a written statement. The court's discretion to condone delay is subject to the principle of sufficient cause.",
    "Context": "This query focuses on the court's discretion to condone delay in filing a written statement under the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, considering the explanation of oversight by counsel as sufficient cause."

  {
    "Query": "A plaintiff in a commercial suit seeks to recover damages from the defendant for breach of contract. The defendant argues that the plaintiff's claim is barred by the doctrine of waiver, as the plaintiff continued to perform under the contract after the alleged breach.  Is the plaintiff's claim barred by waiver?",
    "Legal Principles": "The doctrine of waiver applies when a party, with full knowledge of their rights, intentionally relinquishes or abandons those rights. For a waiver to be effective, there must be a clear and unequivocal act by the party waiving their rights. The mere continuation of performance under a contract, after an alleged breach, does not automatically constitute waiver.",
    "Relevant Sections": "The Indian Contract Act, 1872, governs the principles of contract law. The court must analyze the specific circumstances of the case and the plaintiff's conduct to determine if there was a clear and unequivocal waiver of their rights.",
    "Context": "This query concerns the applicability of the doctrine of waiver in a commercial suit for breach of contract, examining whether the plaintiff's continued performance after the alleged breach constitutes waiver."

  {
    "Query": "A commercial dispute arises between two parties over the interpretation of a contract clause. Both parties present conflicting interpretations, each supported by relevant legal arguments.  How should the court interpret the contract clause to resolve the dispute?",
    "Legal Principles": "The court must interpret a contract clause in accordance with the principles of contract interpretation, aiming to ascertain the parties' intention as expressed in the language of the contract. The court should consider the plain meaning of the words used, the context of the clause within the contract, the surrounding circumstances, and the parties' conduct. The court may also rely on established rules of construction, such as the contra proferentem rule (where ambiguity is construed against the party who drafted the clause).",
    "Relevant Sections": "The Indian Contract Act, 1872, governs the principles of contract interpretation. The court must apply the relevant rules of construction and consider the specific language and context of the disputed clause to determine its intended meaning.",
    "Context": "This query focuses on the interpretation of a contract clause in a commercial dispute, requiring the court to apply the principles of contract interpretation and determine the intended meaning of the clause based on the evidence presented."
  },
  {
    "Query": "A defendant in a commercial suit has filed a written statement denying the plaintiff's allegations and asserting a counterclaim against the plaintiff. The plaintiff argues that the defendant's counterclaim is frivolous and should be dismissed.  Can the court dismiss the defendant's counterclaim?",
    "Legal Principles": "A counterclaim can be dismissed if it is found to be frivolous or vexatious, meaning it is demonstrably baseless or lacks any reasonable foundation in law or fact. The court must consider whether the counterclaim has a genuine legal basis and whether there is a reasonable possibility of success. The plaintiff's arguments against the counterclaim must be assessed based on the evidence presented and legal principles.",
    "Relevant Sections": "Order VIII of the CPC governs counterclaims in civil suits. The court must apply the principles of procedural fairness and consider the legal merits of the counterclaim to determine if it should be dismissed.",
    "Context": "This query addresses the dismissal of a counterclaim in a commercial suit, examining whether the counterclaim is frivolous and considering the legal arguments presented by both parties."

  {
    "Query": "A commercial dispute arises between two parties involving a complex transaction involving multiple contracts and agreements. The parties seek to rely on the parol evidence rule to introduce evidence outside the written contracts.  How should the court apply the parol evidence rule in this case?",
    "Legal Principles": "The parol evidence rule generally prohibits the introduction of extrinsic evidence to contradict, vary, or add to the terms of a written contract that is intended to be the complete and final expression of the parties' agreement.  However, exceptions to the rule exist, such as when the evidence is necessary to explain ambiguities in the written contract, to prove a collateral agreement, or to establish fraud or misrepresentation.",
    "Relevant Sections": "The Indian Contract Act, 1872, governs the application of the parol evidence rule. The court must analyze the specific circumstances of the case and the nature of the extrinsic evidence to determine if it falls within any of the exceptions to the rule.",
    "Context": "This query involves the application of the parol evidence rule in a complex commercial dispute, requiring the court to balance the principle of contract finality with the exceptions to the rule."
