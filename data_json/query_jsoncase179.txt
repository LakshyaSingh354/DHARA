    "Query": "A plaintiff filed a suit in a Civil Court seeking a recovery of a sum of money due under a commercial contract. The defendant argued that the suit should have been filed in the Commercial Court as per the Commercial Courts Act, 2015. The plaintiff argued that they were unaware of the establishment of the Commercial Court and the Civil Court had already granted an order of attachment before judgment. Can the High Court transfer the suit to the Commercial Court under Section 24(5) of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908?",
    "Legal Principles": "The High Court has the power to transfer a suit from a court that has no jurisdiction to try it to a court that has jurisdiction under Section 24(5) of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. The Commercial Courts Act, 2015, provides for the establishment of Commercial Courts to adjudicate on commercial disputes of a specified value. The applicability of Section 24 of the CPC to commercial disputes is not excluded by the Commercial Courts Act. The High Court can transfer a suit filed in a Civil Court to the Commercial Court, even if the suit was filed before the Commercial Court was established, provided the suit involves a commercial dispute of a specified value.",

    "Query": "A company filed a suit in the District Court seeking a declaration of its right to use a particular trademark. The defendant argued that the suit should have been filed in the Intellectual Property Appellate Board (IPAB) as per the Trade Marks Act, 1999. The company argued that they had filed the suit in the District Court as it was a general civil suit, not specifically related to trademarks. Can the High Court transfer the suit to the IPAB?",
    "Legal Principles": "The IPAB is the exclusive forum for appeals against the decisions of the Registrar of Trademarks under the Trade Marks Act, 1999.
