    "Query": "A barge owner is being sued for damages to a stationary diffuser structure caused by a collision during a high tide.

    ],
    "Relevant Sections": "The alleged incident occurred due to an inevitable accident and the said inevitable accident was the parting and mooring rope of another barge and not \"M.V.PREETISAGAR\" and was beyond the reasonable control of defendant No.1 - ASPL and the Master/ crew of the barge. It is submitted that thereafter the situation aggravated by the tidal current which was an act of God. It is submitted that the current caused the set of eight barges to drift and rotate and \"M.V.PREETISAGAR\" was caught by the inflowing tide. It is submitted that therefore, as it was an act of God, as rightly observed by the learned trial court, there is no legal liability on the part of original defendant No.1, and therefore, there is no question of sanctioning the claim under the insurance policy.",
