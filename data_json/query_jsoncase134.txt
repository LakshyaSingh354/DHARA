    "Query": "A company, 'Tech Solutions Inc.', is disputing the fees charged by an arbitrator appointed by the court in a commercial contract dispute. They argue that the arbitrator's fees exceed the prescribed limits in the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, and that the arbitrator's conduct has created a perception of bias and inability to act impartially. Can the court terminate the mandate of the arbitrator under Section 14 of the Act based on the company's concerns?",
    "Legal Principles": "Section 14 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, allows for the termination of an arbitrator's mandate if the arbitrator becomes unable to perform their functions, either de jure or de facto. The court must consider whether the arbitrator's conduct creates a justifiable doubt about their impartiality and independence, leading to a perception of bias or inability to act fairly.",
    "Relevant Sections": "**Section 14. Failure or impossibility to act.**\n(1) The mandate of an arbitrator shall terminate and he shall be substituted by another arbitrator, if-\n(a) He becomes de jure or de facto unable to perform his functions or for other reasons fails to act without undue delay; and\n(b) He withdraws from his office or the parties agree to the termination of his mandate. (2) If a controversy remains concerning any of the grounds referred to in clause (a) of sub-section (1), a party may, unless otherwise agreed by the parties, apply to the Court to decide on the termination of the mandate.\n(3) If, under this section or sub-section (3) of Section 13, an arbitrator withdraws from his office or a party agrees to the termination of the mandate of an arbitrator, it shall not imply acceptance of the validity of any ground referred to in this section or sub-section (3) of Section 12.",
