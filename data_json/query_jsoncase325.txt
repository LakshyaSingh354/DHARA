    "Query": "A partnership firm, 'Tech Solutions,' is facing a dispute.  One partner, Mr. Singh, was removed as managing partner by a majority vote. Mr. Singh claims the removal was wrongful and seeks to prevent the new managing partner from taking over, arguing he still holds the position. Can the court grant an injunction preventing the new managing partner from taking office, especially since the partnership agreement has an arbitration clause?",
    "Legal Principles": "The court can grant an injunction under Section 9 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, if a party demonstrates a manifest intention to arbitrate the dispute and seeks interim protection before or during arbitral proceedings. The injunction should be granted only if the court is satisfied that the applicant has a prima facie case and irreparable harm could result in the absence of an injunction. The court must also consider the balance of convenience and the public interest.",
    "Relevant Sections": "Section 9 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996: \n (1) The court may, at the request of a party, grant interim measures of protection before or during arbitral proceedings or at any time after the making of the arbitral award but before it is enforced in accordance with Section 36.\n (2) When a court passes an order for any interim measure before the commencement of the arbitral proceedings, the arbitral proceedings shall be commenced within a period of ninety days from the date of such order or within such further time as the court may determine.

    "Query": "A company, 'Green Energy,' contracted with a supplier, 'Solar Power,' for solar panels.  The contract included an arbitration clause.  'Solar Power' failed to deliver the panels on time, and 'Green Energy' is facing significant financial losses due to delays in their project. 'Green Energy' wants the court to order 'Solar Power' to deliver the panels immediately, arguing that the delay violates the contract. Should the court intervene and order the delivery, or should it defer to the arbitration process?",
    "Legal Principles": "The court has the power to grant interim relief under Section 9 of the Arbitration Act, but it must consider whether it has the power to order specific performance of the contract.  The court may be reluctant to intervene in a contract dispute that is subject to arbitration, particularly when the parties have agreed to settle disputes through that process.  The court's decision will depend on the specific facts and the potential harm to 'Green Energy' if the panels are not delivered.",
