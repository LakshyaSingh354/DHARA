    "Query": "A company filed an appeal against an order dismissing its plaint under Order VII Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The appeal was filed after a delay of 180 days. The company argued that the delay was due to administrative hurdles and the need for obtaining certain documents. However, the opposing party argued that the delay was excessive and the company had not acted with due diligence. Can the court condone the delay in filing the appeal?",
    "Legal Principles": "Condonation of delay in filing appeals is governed by Section 5 of the Limitation Act, 1963.  The court has the discretion to condone delay if sufficient cause is shown. This discretion is exercised judiciously and  'sufficient cause' requires a genuine reason for the delay, demonstrating diligence and a lack of negligence on the part of the applicant. The court must consider the specific facts and circumstances of the case, including the nature of the delay, the reasons for the delay, and the potential prejudice to the opposing party.  The court must balance the need for finality and the principles of procedural fairness.",

The trial court dismissed the contractor's suit and allowed the government's counterclaim. The contractor filed an appeal against the trial court's judgment, but the appeal was dismissed on technical grounds. The contractor then filed a fresh appeal within 30 days of the dismissal of the first appeal, but it was filed 150 days after the original judgment of the trial court.

The court will also consider the potential prejudice to the opposing party and the overall need for finality in litigation. If the delay is caused by factors beyond the control of the applicant, such as administrative hurdles or legal complexities, the court may be more inclined to condone the delay.  ",
