    "Query": "A borrower has been declared bankrupt by the Debt Recovery Tribunal (DRT) and a recovery certificate has been issued. The borrower's guarantor is now seeking to file a suit against the bank to discharge his guarantee obligations, arguing that the bank had agreed to release the guarantee upon certain conditions being met. Is the guarantor's suit barred by the DRT Act? ",
    "Legal Principles": "The DRT Act bars the jurisdiction of civil courts in matters relating to applications for recovery of debts filed by banks and financial institutions. However, it does not bar suits filed by guarantors against banks for independent relief, such as the discharge of a guarantee obligation.",
    "Relevant Sections": "Section 17, 18, and 19 of the Recovery of Debts and Bankruptcy Act, 1993.",
    "Context": "This query concerns the applicability of the DRT Act to a suit filed by a guarantor against a bank for discharge of a guarantee obligation. The context involves a prior bankruptcy proceeding before the DRT.",

    "Query": "A bank had filed an application for recovery of a debt before the DRT. The borrower filed a counterclaim alleging that the bank had violated the loan agreement and seeking damages. The DRT dismissed the borrower's counterclaim. The borrower now seeks to file a separate suit in the civil court for the same claim for damages. Is the borrower's suit barred by the principle of res judicata?",
    "Legal Principles": "The principle of res judicata prevents the relitigation of issues that have been finally decided by a competent court. A counterclaim filed in a DRT proceeding is considered a final decision for the purposes of res judicata.",
    "Relevant Sections": "Section 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908.",

The plaintiff now seeks to file a suit against the bank alleging fraud and misrepresentation in the loan agreement.  Is the plaintiff's suit barred by the DRT Act?",
    "Legal Principles": "While the DRT Act generally bars civil court jurisdiction in matters relating to debt recovery, it does not bar suits alleging fraud or misrepresentation in the underlying loan agreement.",
