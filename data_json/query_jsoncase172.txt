    "Query": "A partnership dispute arises where one partner is accused of violating the partnership agreement and breaching trust by releasing a film using the partnership's name without consent. The other partners seek an interim injunction to stop the release and use of the partnership's assets. What is the proper forum for the interim injunction application under Section 9 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996?",
    "Legal Principles": "The Commercial Courts Act, 2015 (CC Act, 2015) has jurisdiction over commercial disputes of a specified value, including arbitration matters.  Section 10(3) of the CC Act, 2015 mandates that applications under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (Act, 1996) relating to commercial disputes of a specified value be filed in and heard by the Commercial Court. However, interim injunction applications under Section 9 of the Act, 1996 are not subject to the specified value requirement and are thus not within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Commercial Court.",
    "Relevant Sections": "**Section 2(1)(e) of the Arbitration Act, 1996:** Defines \"Court\" as the principal Civil Court of original jurisdiction in a district.\n**Section 9 of the Arbitration Act, 1996:** Allows for interim measures of protection, including injunctions, to be sought by a party before or during arbitration proceedings.\n**Section 2(1)(c) of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015:** Defines \"commercial dispute\" to include disputes arising out of partnership agreements.\n**Section 10(3) of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015:**  Directs that applications under the Act, 1996 relating to commercial disputes of a specified value be filed in the Commercial Court.\n**Section 15 of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015:** Deals with the transfer of pending cases to the Commercial Court for commercial disputes of a specified value.",
    "Context": "The case involves a partnership dispute with allegations of breach of trust and violation of the partnership agreement. The parties are seeking an interim injunction under Section 9 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, to protect the partnership's assets pending arbitration proceedings. The issue is whether the Commercial Court has jurisdiction to hear this interim injunction application."

    "Query": "A construction company sues a client for breach of contract, claiming a payment of ₹5 lakh for work completed. The client denies the claim and counterclaims for ₹2 lakh in damages due to delays.  The dispute goes to arbitration, and the company seeks an interim injunction to prevent the client from using the construction materials until the arbitration is complete. What court has jurisdiction over the interim injunction application?",
    "Legal Principles": "The Commercial Courts Act, 2015 (CC Act, 2015) applies to commercial disputes of a specified value, including arbitration matters. Since the value of the dispute exceeds the threshold of ₹3 lakh, the Commercial Court has jurisdiction. Interim injunction applications under Section 9 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, even if not specifically valued, are still considered part of the overall commercial dispute and therefore fall under the jurisdiction of the Commercial Court.",
    "Relevant Sections": "**Section 2(1)(c) of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015:** Defines \"commercial dispute\" to include construction contracts.\n**Section 10(3) of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015:**  Directs that applications under the Act, 1996 relating to commercial disputes of a specified value be filed in the Commercial Court.\n**Section 12 of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015:** Determines the \"Specified Value\" of a commercial dispute.\n**Section 9 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996:** Allows for interim measures of protection, including injunctions, to be sought by a party before or during arbitration proceedings.",
    "Context": "This case involves a construction contract dispute between a company and a client, with a total value exceeding ₹3 lakh, making it a commercial dispute under the CC Act, 2015. The company seeks an interim injunction under Section 9 of the Act, 1996 to prevent the client from using the construction materials pending arbitration proceedings. The question is whether the interim injunction application falls under the jurisdiction of the Commercial Court due to the overall commercial nature of the dispute."

    "Query": "A technology company accuses a former employee of stealing confidential trade secrets and using them to launch a competing business. The company seeks a permanent injunction to stop the employee from using the stolen information and an order for the destruction of all copies of the trade secrets.  The employee denies the allegations and claims the information was publicly available. The dispute goes to arbitration, and the company seeks a preliminary injunction to stop the employee from using the alleged stolen trade secrets until the arbitration is complete. Which court is the proper forum for the preliminary injunction?",
    "Legal Principles": "The Commercial Courts Act, 2015 (CC Act, 2015) has jurisdiction over commercial disputes of a specified value, including intellectual property rights disputes. The value of the alleged stolen trade secrets is not explicitly stated, but the potential damage to the technology company could be significant, making it a commercial dispute of a specified value.  Therefore, the Commercial Court has jurisdiction over the preliminary injunction application, even though it is technically under Section 9 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, because it is related to the overall commercial dispute.",
    "Relevant Sections": "**Section 2(1)(c)(xvii) of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015:** Defines \"commercial dispute\" to include intellectual property rights disputes.\n**Section 10(3) of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015:**  Directs that applications under the Act, 1996 relating to commercial disputes of a specified value be filed in the Commercial Court.\n**Section 9 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996:** Allows for interim measures of protection, including injunctions, to be sought by a party before or during arbitration proceedings.",
