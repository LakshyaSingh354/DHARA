    "Query": "A corporation entered into a construction contract with a contractor. The contract included an arbitration clause. Disputes arose during the execution of the work. The contractor sought arbitration to resolve the disputes. The corporation filed a counterclaim. The arbitrator issued an award in favor of the contractor. The corporation appealed the award, but the appeal was dismissed. The contractor filed an execution petition to recover the amount awarded by the arbitrator. The corporation argued that the execution petition should be dismissed because the claim was below the specified value and the Commercial Court lacked jurisdiction.  What is the jurisdiction of the Commercial Court to execute the arbitral award in this case?",
    "Legal Principles": "The jurisdiction of a court to execute an arbitral award is determined by the Arbitration Act, the Commercial Courts Act, and the Code of Civil Procedure.  The Commercial Court has exclusive jurisdiction to decide commercial disputes of a specified value. The specified value of a commercial dispute arising from an arbitration is determined by the aggregate value of the claim and counterclaim. The Court which passed the decree is competent to execute it. A decree is executable by a Court which passed it. An arbitral award is deemed to be a decree of the court for the purposes of execution. The court which has jurisdiction to hear the arbitration proceedings is the same court which has jurisdiction to execute the award.",
    "Relevant Sections": "Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, Section 36 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, Section 2(e) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, Section 2(c) and 2(i) of the Commercial Courts, Commercial Division and Commercial Appellate Division of High Courts Act, 2015, Section 12 of the Commercial Courts, Commercial Division and Commercial Appellate Division of High Courts Act, 2015, Section 37 and 38 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, Section 15 of the Commercial Courts, Commercial Division and Commercial Appellate Division of High Courts Act, 2015, Section 50 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, Section 13(1) of the Commercial Courts, Commercial Division and Commercial Appellate Division of High Courts Act, 2015",

    "Query": "Two parties entered into a contract for the supply of goods. A dispute arose between the parties and the matter went to arbitration. The arbitrator issued an award in favor of one party. The losing party filed an appeal against the award under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act, which was dismissed by the Commercial Court. The winning party filed an execution petition in the Commercial Court to enforce the award. The losing party argued that the Commercial Court lacked jurisdiction to execute the award because the value of the claim was below the specified value for the Commercial Court. Is the Commercial Court's jurisdiction to execute the award dependent on the value of the claim in the execution petition?",
    "Legal Principles": "The jurisdiction of a court to execute an arbitral award is not dependent on the value of the claim in the execution petition. The jurisdiction is determined by the value of the claim and counterclaim in the original arbitration proceedings. If the aggregate value of the claim and counterclaim in the arbitration was above the specified value for the Commercial Court, then the Commercial Court has jurisdiction to execute the award, even if the value of the claim in the execution petition is below the specified value.

    "Query": "A company filed an execution petition to enforce an arbitral award against another company. The opposing company argued that the execution petition should be dismissed because the value of the claim was below the specified value for the Commercial Court. The execution petition was filed in the same Commercial Court that had dismissed the opposing company's appeal against the arbitral award. Can the Commercial Court, based on the previous jurisdiction in the appeal, execute the award despite the value of the claim being below the specified value?",
    "Legal Principles": "The Commercial Court has jurisdiction to execute an arbitral award if it had jurisdiction over the subject matter of the arbitration. The specified value for the Commercial Court is determined by the aggregate value of the claim and counterclaim in the original arbitration proceedings. If the Commercial Court had jurisdiction to hear the appeal against the award, then it has jurisdiction to execute the award, even if the value of the claim in the execution petition is below the specified value. The court's jurisdiction in the appeal proceedings establishes its jurisdiction in the execution proceedings.",

    "Query": "A construction company filed an execution petition in the Commercial Court to enforce an arbitral award against a developer. The developer argued that the Commercial Court lacked jurisdiction because the value of the claim in the execution petition was below the specified value. The original arbitration involved a claim exceeding the specified value, but the execution petition only sought recovery of a portion of the award. Is the value of the claim in the execution petition determinative of the court's jurisdiction?",
    "Legal Principles": "The value of the claim in the execution petition is not determinative of the court's jurisdiction. The court's jurisdiction is determined by the value of the claim and counterclaim in the original arbitration proceedings. If the original arbitration involved a claim exceeding the specified value, then the Commercial Court has jurisdiction to execute the award, even if the value of the claim in the execution petition is below the specified value. The court's jurisdiction is based on the value of the original arbitration, not the execution petition.",

    "Query": "Two companies entered into a contract for the supply of services. The contract contained an arbitration clause. A dispute arose between the companies, and the matter went to arbitration. The arbitrator issued an award in favor of one company. The losing company appealed the award to the Commercial Court, but the appeal was dismissed. The winning company filed an execution petition to enforce the award. The losing company argued that the execution petition should be dismissed because the Commercial Court lacked jurisdiction as it was an international commercial arbitration.  What is the jurisdiction of the Commercial Court to execute the award in this case?",
    "Legal Principles": "The jurisdiction of the Commercial Court to execute an arbitral award depends on whether the arbitration was domestic or international. In cases of international commercial arbitration, the Commercial Division of the High Court has jurisdiction to execute the award. In cases of domestic commercial arbitration, the Commercial Court exercising territorial jurisdiction over the arbitration has jurisdiction. The Court's jurisdiction is established by the nature of the arbitration, not the value of the claim.",

    "Legal Principles": "The Commercial Court has jurisdiction to execute a foreign award if it was rendered in a country with which India has a reciprocal arrangement for the enforcement of foreign awards.
