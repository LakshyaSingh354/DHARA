    "Query": "A company, 'ABC Technologies', filed a suit against 'XYZ Enterprises' for breach of contract. The contract involved the supply of specialized equipment.  XYZ Enterprises failed to file a written statement within the stipulated timeframe, leading to an ex-parte order against them.

How does the principle of 'directory vs. mandatory provisions' apply in this case, and what are the relevant legal precedents?",
    "Legal Principles": "The legal principles at play in this case involve the interpretation of procedural rules, particularly the distinction between directory and mandatory provisions.
