    "Query": "A defendant in a commercial suit failed to file a written statement within the 120-day time limit set by the Commercial Courts Act. The defendant now seeks condonation of delay, arguing that they were unable to file the statement due to unforeseen circumstances. Can the court grant the condonation of delay?",
    "Legal Principles": "The Commercial Courts Act mandates that a defendant in a commercial suit must file a written statement within 120 days from the date of service of summons. This time limit is mandatory and cannot be extended by the court beyond 120 days.  The court's inherent power under Section 151 of the CPC cannot be used to circumvent this mandatory provision.",
    "Relevant Sections": "Order VIII Rule 1 (as amended by the Commercial Courts Act): Provided that where the defendant fails to file the written statement within the said period of thirty days, he shall be allowed to file the written statement on such other day, as may be specified by the Court, for reasons to be recorded in writing and on payment of such costs as the Court deems fit, but which shall not be later than one hundred twenty days from the date of service of summons and on expiry of one hundred twenty days from the date of service of summons, the defendant shall forfeit the right to file the written statement and the Court shall not allow the written statement to be taken on record.  Order VIII Rule 10 (as amended by the Commercial Courts Act): Provided further that no Court shall make an order to extend the time provided under Rule 1 of this Order for filing of the written statement.",

    "Query": "A plaintiff in a commercial suit failed to disclose all documents in their possession relevant to the suit, as required by Order XI Rule 1 of the CPC (as amended by the Commercial Courts Act). The defendant argues that the plaintiff's failure to disclose documents constitutes a bar to the suit and the plaint should be rejected. Can the court reject the plaint on this ground?",
    "Legal Principles": "Order XI Rule 1 of the CPC mandates that the plaintiff in a commercial suit must disclose all documents in their possession relevant to the suit. This obligation to disclose documents applies to all documents in the plaintiff's power, possession, control or custody, irrespective of whether they are in support of or adverse to the plaintiff's case.  While the plaintiff is obligated to disclose relevant documents, failure to disclose does not necessarily constitute a bar to the suit. The court has the power to grant leave to the plaintiff to rely on undisclosed documents if the plaintiff establishes reasonable cause for non-disclosure.",
    "Relevant Sections": "Order XI Rule 1 of the CPC (as amended by the Commercial Courts Act): (5) The plaintiff shall not be allowed to rely on documents, which were in the plaintiff's power, possession, control or custody and not disclosed along with plaint or within the extended period set out above, save and except by leave of Court and such leave shall be granted only upon the plaintiff establishing reasonable cause for non-disclosure along with the plaint.",

    "Query": "A defendant in a commercial suit filed in the Commercial Division of the Bombay High Court seeks to file a written statement after the 120-day time limit has expired. The defendant argues that the Bombay High Court (Original Side) Rules, which allow for condonation of delay, should apply in this case. Can the court rely on the Bombay High Court (Original Side) Rules to condone the delay in filing the written statement?",
    "Legal Principles": "The Commercial Courts Act has amended the CPC to introduce a mandatory 120-day time limit for filing a written statement in commercial suits. This time limit is applicable to all Commercial Divisions of High Courts, including the Bombay High Court. The Bombay High Court (Original Side) Rules cannot be used to circumvent the mandatory provisions of the Commercial Courts Act.  While the Bombay High Court (Original Side) Rules are special law, the Commercial Courts Act, as a later special law, overrides the Bombay High Court (Original Side) Rules in case of a conflict.",

This time limit is applicable to all Commercial Divisions of High Courts, including the Bombay High Court.

    "Legal Principles": "Order VI Rule 17 of the CPC allows the court to permit amendments to pleadings at any stage of the proceedings if it is satisfied that the amendment is necessary for the ends of justice and that it will not cause prejudice to the other party. The court has to balance the plaintiff's right to amend their pleading with the defendant's right to a fair trial. If the court finds that the amendment is likely to cause undue prejudice to the defendant, it may refuse to allow the amendment. However, the court can impose terms on the plaintiff as a condition for allowing the amendment to mitigate any prejudice to the defendant. ",

However, the court can only proceed ex parte if it is satisfied that the defendant has been duly served with the summons.

    "Legal Principles": "Order VIII Rule 10 of the CPC allows the court to strike out a pleading that is considered to be frivolous or vexatious. The court has to determine if the written statement raises a genuine issue for trial. If the court finds that the written statement is frivolous or vexatious, it can strike it out.
