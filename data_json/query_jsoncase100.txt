    "Query": "A landowner's land was acquired for a national highway under the National Highways Act, 1956. The landowner was dissatisfied with the compensation awarded by the Statutory Arbitrator. Can the landowner challenge the award under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, and if so, before which court?",
    "Legal Principles": "The award of the Statutory Arbitrator under Section 3G(5) of the National Highways Act, 1956, can be challenged under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. The application under Section 34 should be filed before the court of competent jurisdiction, which is not the Commercial Court in this case because the dispute is not considered a 'commercial dispute'.",
    "Relevant Sections": "Section 3G of the National Highways Act, 1956, Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, Section 2(1)(c) of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015",
    "Context": "This case concerns the challenge of an award made by a Statutory Arbitrator under the National Highways Act, 1956, involving land acquisition for highway construction. The legal question revolves around the jurisdiction of the Commercial Court and the proper forum for challenging such an award."

    "Query": "A property owner's land was acquired for a highway project under the National Highways Act, 1956. The owner was unhappy with the compensation awarded and sought review under the Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013. Is this the correct approach, given the limited applicability of the 2013 Act to acquisitions under the 1956 Act?",
    "Legal Principles": "The Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013, has limited applicability to acquisitions under the National Highways Act, 1956, primarily for determining compensation, solatium, and interest. The procedural aspects and remedies for challenging compensation remain governed by the 1956 Act.",
    "Relevant Sections": "Section 3G of the National Highways Act, 1956, Section 113 of the Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013, Fourth Schedule of the Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013",
    "Context": "This case involves the application of the 2013 Act to land acquisitions under the 1956 Act. The Court needs to clarify the extent of the 2013 Act's applicability and the proper remedies available to landowners under the 1956 Act."

    "Query": "A dispute arose between a landowner and the government over compensation for land acquired for a national highway project under the National Highways Act, 1956. The landowner sought to challenge the Statutory Arbitrator's award under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, but the Commercial Court dismissed the application. Was the Commercial Court's decision correct?",
    "Legal Principles": "The Commercial Court is not the proper forum for challenging an award under the National Highways Act, 1956, when the dispute is not classified as a 'commercial dispute' under the Commercial Courts Act, 2015. The landowner should file the Section 34 application before the court of competent jurisdiction, likely the Principal Civil Court of original jurisdiction in the district.",

    "Query": "A landowner's property was acquired for a highway project under the National Highways Act, 1956. The landowner claims that the land was residential in nature and should have been compensated at residential rates, but the Statutory Arbitrator determined it as agricultural land. Can the landowner challenge this decision?",
    "Legal Principles": "The Statutory Arbitrator's decision regarding the classification of the land (agricultural vs. residential) is subject to challenge under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. The landowner can argue that the Arbitrator erred in determining the nature of the land and the appropriate compensation rate.",

    "Legal Principles": "While the Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013, applies to acquisitions under the National Highways Act, 1956, for certain aspects of compensation, the procedural remedies and challenges remain governed by the 1956 Act. The landowner cannot directly seek review under the 2013 Act in this case.",
