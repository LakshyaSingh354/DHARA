    "Query": "A company, 'ABC Corp', filed a summary suit for recovery of Rs. 10 crore against 'XYZ Ltd' for unpaid invoices for goods supplied. 'XYZ Ltd' applied for leave to defend, claiming there was no written contract and the suit was improperly instituted. The court granted conditional leave to defend upon the deposit of Rs. 2 crore. 'XYZ Ltd' failed to deposit the amount and the suit was decreed against them. 'XYZ Ltd' now appeals the court's decision to grant conditional leave, arguing they should have received unconditional leave due to triable issues. What are the legal principles and relevant sections guiding the court's decision regarding granting leave to defend in summary suits?",
    "Legal Principles": "The court's decision to grant leave to defend in summary suits is guided by Order XXXVII of the Code of Civil Procedure (CPC) and the principle of 'triable issues'. The court must determine if the defendant raises genuine triable issues that warrant a full trial, or if the defence is merely frivolous or vexatious. This principle was further clarified in the landmark case of *IDBI Trusteeship Services Limited vs. Hubtown Limited* (2017) 1 SCC 568, which superseded the principles stated in *Mechelec Engineers and Manufacturers vs. Basic Equipment Corporation* (1976) 4 SCC 687.",
    "Relevant Sections": "Order XXXVII of the CPC governs summary suits, particularly Rule 2 regarding the nature of contracts and Rule 3 regarding granting leave to defend. This case also touches upon Section 46 of the Companies Act, which mandates the approval of the Board of Directors for any written agreement or contract entered into by a company.",
    "Context": "This is a case from the jurisdiction of the Gujarat High Court, involving a First Appeal challenging a decision of the Commercial Court regarding leave to defend in a summary suit for recovery of dues. The case highlights the issue of whether the court should grant conditional leave based on the deposit of a specific amount, or unconditional leave, despite the defendant's potential claim of triable issues."

    "Query": "A construction company, 'BuildRight Ltd', filed a summary suit against 'Property Developers Inc' for recovery of Rs. 5 crore for breach of a construction contract.

The court granted conditional leave to defend upon the deposit of Rs. 1 crore. 'Property Developers Inc' appealed the court's decision, arguing they have a strong defence based on the contract's invalidity. What are the legal principles and relevant sections that should guide the court in deciding whether to uphold the conditional leave to defend?",
    "Legal Principles": "The legal principles governing this case involve the validity of contracts, specifically the principle of 'mistake' as a potential ground for invalidating a contract.

    "Relevant Sections": "The relevant sections would include the provisions of the Indian Contract Act, specifically Section 20, which deals with contracts made under a 'mistake' and their potential for invalidity.
