    "Query": "A company in Hyderabad, M/s. Gopinath Enterprise Private Limited, received invoices from a supplier, Ikon Associates, based in Kalol, Gujarat, with a clause stating 'Subject to Ahmedabad jurisdiction'. The company subsequently made payments through RTGS to the supplier's bank account in Ahmedabad. Does the presence of this clause in the invoices, along with the payments made in Ahmedabad, confer exclusive jurisdiction on the Ahmedabad Court, excluding the jurisdiction of the Kalol Court?",
    "Legal Principles": "The principles of territorial jurisdiction in civil suits are governed by Section 20 of the Code of Civil Procedure (CPC) and any jurisdiction clause included in an agreement must be unambiguous and specific to bind the parties.  The maxim 'expressio unius est exclusio alterius' (expression of one is the exclusion of another) may be applied in cases where a jurisdiction clause is present, but only if the intention to exclude all other courts is clear. ",
    "Relevant Sections": "Section 20 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908:  '20. Other suits to be instituted where defendants reside or cause of action arises.-Subject to the limitations aforesaid, every suit shall be instituted in a Court within the local limits of whose jurisdiction- (a) the defendant, or each of the defendants where there are more than one, at the time of the commencement of the suit, actually and voluntarily resides, or carries on business, or personally works for gain, or (b) any of the defendants, where there are more than one, at the time of the commencement of the suit, actually, voluntarily resides, or carries on business, or personally work for gain, provided that in such case either the leave of the Court is given, or the defendants who do not reside, or carry on business, or personally work for gain, as aforesaid, acquiesce in such institution; or (c) the cause of action, wholly or in part, arises.'",
    "Context": "This is a case concerning the territorial jurisdiction of courts in a commercial dispute arising from a contract between a supplier and a purchaser. The question revolves around the validity and effect of a jurisdiction clause included in invoices issued by the supplier."

    "Query": "A contractor, based in Mumbai, was awarded a project in Bangalore. The contract specified that any disputes arising from the project would be settled in the Mumbai courts. The contractor later filed a suit against the client, also based in Bangalore, in the Mumbai court. However, the client argued that the suit should be filed in the Bangalore court, as the project was executed in Bangalore. Which court has jurisdiction to hear the case?",
    "Legal Principles": "Section 20 of the CPC determines territorial jurisdiction. The parties can agree on an exclusive forum for dispute resolution, but such agreements must be unambiguous and clear, and must not oust the jurisdiction of courts that would otherwise have jurisdiction. A mere unilateral clause in a contract may not be sufficient to confer exclusive jurisdiction on a specific court.",
    "Relevant Sections": "Section 20 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908:  '20. Other suits to be instituted where defendants reside or cause of action arises.-Subject to the limitations aforesaid, every suit shall be instituted in a Court within the local limits of whose jurisdiction- (a) the defendant, or each of the defendants where there are more than one, at the time of the commencement of the suit, actually and voluntarily resides, or carries on business, or personally works for gain, or (b) any of the defendants, where there are more than one, at the time of the commencement of the suit, actually, voluntarily resides, or carries on business, or personally work for gain, provided that in such case either the leave of the Court is given, or the defendants who do not reside, or carry on business, or personally work for gain, as aforesaid, acquiesce in such institution; or (c) the cause of action, wholly or in part, arises.'",

    "Query": "A customer in Delhi purchased a product online from a company based in Chennai. The company's website included a clause stating that any disputes would be resolved in the Chennai courts. The customer later filed a complaint against the company in a consumer forum in Delhi for a defective product. Can the company insist on the Chennai court's jurisdiction, or can the customer pursue their complaint in the Delhi consumer forum?",
    "Legal Principles": "The principle of 'debtor seeking the creditor' is applicable in cases where no place of payment is specified in a contract.  This principle suggests that the debtor must seek out the creditor for payment, making the creditor's place of residence a potential jurisdiction for a suit. The Consumer Protection Act, 2019 provides for consumer forums in various jurisdictions, offering a forum for consumer complaints.",

The lease agreement contained a clause stating that any disputes arising from the lease would be settled in the Kolkata courts. The tenant later filed a suit against the landlord in the Mumbai court regarding a breach of the lease agreement. Is the Mumbai court competent to hear the case?",
    "Legal Principles": "While parties can agree to a specific court's jurisdiction, such clauses must be clear and unambiguous and cannot override the inherent jurisdiction of other courts where the cause of action may arise. The cause of action in a lease dispute can arise at the place where the property is located, as this is where the breach of the agreement is felt.",
