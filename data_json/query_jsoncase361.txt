    "Query": "A non-banking financial company filed an execution petition for an arbitration award against a borrower in a commercial court. The court dismissed the petition citing a lack of jurisdiction due to the absence of a state notification specifying a pecuniary value under the Commercial Courts Act, 2015. Can the company challenge this dismissal and what is the relevant legal framework?",
    "Legal Principles": "The Commercial Courts Act, 2015, as amended by the Commercial Courts, Commercial Division and Commercial Appellate Division of High Courts (Amendment) Act, 2018 (28 of 2018), establishes a framework for commercial courts, including provisions for pecuniary jurisdiction and the role of state government notifications.",

    "Context": "This case involves the execution of an arbitration award in a commercial court, where the court's jurisdiction is contested based on the applicability of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 and its amendments, specifically concerning the pecuniary value threshold and the requirement of state government notifications."

    "Query": "A construction company sued another company for breach of contract in a commercial court. The defendant argued that the commercial court lacked jurisdiction because the value of the subject-matter was below the specified value stipulated by the state government notification. The court agreed with the defendant and dismissed the case. Is this dismissal legally sound?",
    "Legal Principles": "The Commercial Courts Act, 2015, as amended, designates the pecuniary jurisdiction of commercial courts, and state governments are empowered to notify specific value thresholds for their respective jurisdictions. This notification process is crucial for determining the court's competence to hear cases.",

    "Query": "A business partnership filed a case in a commercial court seeking to dissolve the partnership and divide assets. The defendant argued that the commercial court lacked jurisdiction because the case did not fall within the definition of a 'commercial dispute' as defined in the Commercial Courts Act, 2015. The court dismissed the case. Was this dismissal justified?",
    "Legal Principles": "The Commercial Courts Act, 2015, defines the scope of 'commercial disputes' that fall under the jurisdiction of commercial courts. Partnership disputes, while involving commercial elements, may not always qualify as commercial disputes under the Act.",

    "Context": "This case involves a partnership dispute that was dismissed by a commercial court on the grounds that it did not meet the definition of a 'commercial dispute' as per the Commercial Courts Act, 2015.

    "Query": "A company filed a case in a commercial court against another company for trademark infringement. The defendant argued that the commercial court lacked jurisdiction because the case involved intellectual property rights and not a 'commercial dispute' as defined under the Commercial Courts Act, 2015. The court upheld the defendant's argument. Was this decision correct?",
    "Legal Principles": "The Commercial Courts Act, 2015, defines 'commercial disputes' that fall within the purview of commercial courts. While intellectual property disputes may have commercial aspects, their core nature often falls under specialized intellectual property laws, potentially excluding them from the scope of commercial courts.",
